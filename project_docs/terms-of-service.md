## What Withinly Is (And Isn't)

Withinly is a **personal reflection tool** that helps you understand your emotional patterns and relationship dynamics.

**We are NOT:**

- A crisis intervention service
- A mental health treatment provider
- A replacement for therapy or professional help
- A licensed counseling service

**If you're in crisis or experiencing thoughts of self-harm, please contact a crisis hotline immediately:** 988 (US), 112 (EU), or text HOME to 741741.

## By Using Withinly, You Agree To:

### 1. Use This Tool Responsibly

- Be honest with yourself in your reflections — it helps you get accurate insights
- Use this tool for personal growth and self-understanding
- Understand this is **not a substitute for therapy, medical advice, or crisis support**
- Seek professional help if you're struggling with mental health, relationship crises, or safety concerns

### 2. Understand AI Limitations

**Our AI consultant can:**

- Help you reflect on patterns and behaviors
- Offer perspectives based on your trait data
- Support your self-exploration journey

**Our AI consultant can also:**

- Make mistakes or misunderstand what you're saying
- Provide insights that don't resonate with you
- Give advice that isn't helpful in your specific situation
- Miss important context or nuance

**You are responsible for** all decisions you make based on insights from Withinly. We cannot be held liable for any actions, relationship decisions, or life choices influenced by AI-generated content, reports, or conversations.

### 3. Respect the Space

- Speak respectfully, even to the AI — this space is for reflection, not abuse
- Don't use Withinly to harm yourself or others
- Don't share copyrighted content from reports without permission
- Don't attempt to manipulate, exploit, or misuse the service

**We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts** if we detect:

- Suspicious activity (unusual login patterns, token abuse, automated usage)
- Violations of these terms
- Behavior that threatens the service or other users

**Note:** We don't monitor the content of your conversations (they're private), but we can see usage patterns and system activity.

### 4. Understand Partner Sync

When you connect with a partner:

- Only synthesized couple insights are visible to both of you
- Your individual trait details and chat history remain private
- **If either partner unlinks:** Both lose access to couple reports, and that data is deleted
- Don't use Partner Sync to manipulate, coerce, or harm your partner
- You're both responsible for how you use shared insights

### 5. Payment & Sparks

- **Sparks are non-refundable** once purchased
- Exception: If a technical error prevents report generation or chat usage, we'll restore your Sparks or issue a refund at our discretion
- **If report generation fails:** Your Sparks are NOT deducted
- **If you delete your account:** Unused Sparks are forfeited (no refunds)
- We reserve the right to adjust Spark pricing with notice

### 6. Content & Intellectual Property

- Reports, assessments, and AI-generated insights are for your personal use only
- You may share your own reports privately (with partners, therapists, etc.)
- Don't reproduce, distribute, or commercialize Withinly content without permission
- The underlying assessment frameworks, prompts, and AI architecture are proprietary

### 7. Account & Data

- You're responsible for maintaining account security
- You can delete your account and data anytime through your profile
- We'll retain some data temporarily for legal, security, or fraud prevention purposes (see Privacy Policy)
- If you violate these terms, we may suspend or delete your account

### 8. Changes to Service & Terms

- We may modify features, pricing, or these terms as Withinly evolves
- **You'll be notified in-app** when terms change and asked to accept the new version
- Continued use after accepting updated terms means you agree to the changes
- We'll never make changes designed to harm or exploit you

**Limitation of Liability:**  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Withinly and its creators are not liable for any damages, decisions, or outcomes resulting from your use of this service — including relationship decisions, emotional distress, or actions taken based on AI insights.

**Your Responsibility:**  
You use Withinly at your own risk. We provide tools for reflection; you decide how to use the insights you receive.
