# 🚀 Withinly Closed Beta Strategy

## 🎯 Beta Goals

- Validate **core value** → Do users actually feel insights are meaningful and worth returning to?
- Test **pricing willingness** → Do users buy Sparks after free ones run out?
- Identify **critical UX blockers** → Where people get stuck or drop off.
- Observe **couple sync usage** → Does Partner Sync create viral pull?

---

## 👥 Beta Users

- **Target size**: 20–30 users (mix of singles + couples)
- **Recruitment**: personal network, social channels, trusted early adopters
- **Criteria**: Interested in relationships/psychology, open to reflection

---

## 🎁 Beta Coupon

- Each tester gets **12 Sparks (~€6 retail value)**
- Can be spent on any feature (reports, chat, partner sync)
- Natural paywall when Sparks run out

---

## 📅 Timeline

- **Week 1** → Recruit users, onboard first wave
- **Week 2** → Encourage at least 5 couples to sync
- **Week 3** → Collect feedback via short form + 3–5 interviews
- **Week 4** → Wrap-up, analyze patterns, refine strategy

---

## 📊 Core Metrics (Simplified)

Since we don’t have full tracking infra yet, we’ll focus on **manual + lightweight metrics**.

### Must-Have Data

1. **Trait completion** → How many traits each user finishes (manual backend check)
2. **Sparks usage** → What users spend Sparks on (reports vs chat vs sync)
3. **Purchasing signal** → Do users ask for more Sparks once free ones run out? (form + interview)
4. **Couple sync** → How many invitations sent, how many accepted (manual count)

### Nice-to-Have Data (only if easy)

- Chat vs report ratio
- Report feedback stars (simple manual export)

## 📝 Feedback Collection

### In-App Prompts (already implemented)

- **Trait Feedback** → 👍 Felt true / 👎 Didn’t fit me
- **Report Feedback** → ⭐ 1–5 scale (“How insightful was this?”)
- **Chat Feedback (per AI message)** →
  - **Primary (always visible):** 👍 Helpful / 👎 Not helpful
  - **Secondary (on click):**
    - Positive: ❤️ Resonated / 💡 New perspective / 🎯 Needed / 🤝 Good direction
    - Negative: 🤔 Missed the point / 😔 Misunderstood / 🌊 Too surface level / 🔄 Off track

### Google Form (2 parts)

**After first session (24–48h):**

1. How many traits did you complete? (1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / none)
2. What did you spend your Sparks on? (basic reports / premium reports / chat / couple sync / haven’t spent yet)
3. Which feature gave you the most value so far? (traits / basic reports / premium reports / chat / partner sync)
4. What confused you or felt difficult to use? (open text)

**After Sparks depletion:**

5. When Sparks ran out, what did you want to do next? (buy more / satisfied / lost interest)

6. Would you pay for more Sparks? (yes / maybe / no — too expensive / no — not valuable)

7. If yes/maybe: What price feels right for 10 Sparks? (€2–3 / €4–5 / €6–7 / €8+)

8. Did you try syncing with a partner? (yes completed / yes but partner didn’t engage / tried but failed / not interested)

9. **NPS Question** → How likely are you to recommend Withinly to a friend or partner? (0–10 scale)

### Short 1:1 Calls (optional, 3–5 users)

- Walk me through your first experience — what stood out?
- Which report felt most valuable?
- Did you use chat? Why or why not?
- Would you pay for this? What feels like a fair price?
- If you could keep only one feature, which would it be?

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- ≥60% of users complete at least 3 traits
- ≥20% say they would pay for Sparks (ideally 2–3 actually do)
- ≥25% of couples (who marked "in relationship") attempt Partner Sync
- Reports rated ≥3.5/5 on average
- NPS score ≥7 (positive signal for investor story)

---

## 💡 Post-Beta Decisions

- If retention is weak → add lighter recurring features before launch
- If Spark purchases <20% → revisit pricing/value framing
- If couples don’t sync → adjust Partner Sync flow & copy
- If chat ignored → reposition or simplify for launch
