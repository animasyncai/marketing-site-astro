## Overview

This questionnaire explores how aware you are of your inner world, including your thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations, and how you notice and respond to them. It examines both your **mindfulness**—the ability to be present and observe without judgment—and your **self-awareness**—the understanding of your internal patterns and the meaning behind your experiences.

## Evaluation Instructions

### Step 1: Calculate Mindfulness Score

Add up the scores from questions 1-6 only (exclude questions 7-10):

- Possible range: 6-24 points
- Higher scores indicate greater mindfulness

### Step 2: Determine Mindfulness Level

Based on total mindfulness score:

- **6-10 points**: Distracted, unaware
- **11 – 15 points**: Occasionally present
- **16-20 points**: Aware, attentive
- **21-24 points**: Consistently present

### Step 3: Calculate Self-Awareness Score

Add up the scores from questions 7-10 only (exclude questions 1-6):

- Possible range: 4-16 points
- Higher scores indicate self-awareness

### Step 4: Determine Self-Awareness Level

Based on total self-awareness score:

- **4-6 points**: Unaware, reactive
- **7-9 points**: Some insight
- **10-12 points**: Reflective, conscious
- **13-16 points**: Deeply aware

### Step 5: Combine results form Mindfulness part (questions 1-6) and Self-awareness part (questions 7-10)

**Mindfulness (6–24)**

- **Distracted, unaware:** 6 – 10
- **Occasionally present:** 11 – 15
- **Aware, attentive:** 16 – 20
- **Consistently present:** 21 – 24

**Self-Awareness (4–16)**

- **Unaware, reactive:** 4 – 6
- **Some insight:** 7 – 9
- **Reflective, conscious:** 10 – 12
- **Deeply aware:** 13 – 16

### Step 6: Calculate Subscores

Subscores capture distinct dimensions across mindfulness and self-awareness:

**presentAwareness** = avg(M1, (5-M2), M6)

- Measures: Noticing in daily life + practice habit
- Questions: Noticing emotions/sensations, autopilot (reversed), regular practice
- Note: M2 reversed via (5-M2) since it measures negative behavior

**nonreactiveObserving** = avg(M3, M4)

- Measures: Observing without getting caught or resisting
- Questions: Stepping back from busy thoughts, staying with experiences

**responseFlexibility** = M5

- Measures: Pausing before reacting when challenged
- Questions: Observing reaction and responding mindfully

**internalStateAwareness** = avg(SW7, SW8)

- Measures: Differentiating thoughts, emotions, sensations
- Questions: Noticing mind-body-emotion connections, differentiating internal states

**emotionalInsight** = avg(SW9, SW10)

- Measures: Understanding meaning and triggers behind emotions
- Questions: Connecting emotions to needs, recognizing patterns/past triggers

**Metadata:**

- Score range: 1.0 - 4.0 (same as individual questions)
- Thresholds: LOW < 2.0 | MODERATE 2.0-3.0 | HIGH > 3.0
- Use: Enriches behavioral profiles with specific patterns (e.g., "understands emotions intellectually but misses them in real-time")

## Questionnaire Design Rationale

### Comprehensive Coverage

The 6 core questions assess key mindfulness dimensions identified in research:

1. Present-moment awareness (emotions/sensations)
2. **Observing & emotional regulation (staying present with difficulty)**
3. **Response flexibility (formal mindfulness engagement)**
4. **Internal state awareness (identifying&differentiating thoughts, emotions and sensations)**
5. **Integration (mind-body connections)**
6. **Insight (meaning behind emotions&feelings)**

### Core Dimensions Assessed:

Mindfullness

- Present-moment awareness: noticing sensations, emotions, actions; engaging in mindful practices
- Observing & emotional regulation: observing thoughts/emotions without judgment or attachment
- Non-reactivity / response flexibility: pausing before reacting; responding consciously rather than automatically

Self-Awareness

- Internal state awareness: identifying&differentiating thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations as they arise.
- Mind-body-emotion integration: recognizing the connections and interplay between physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts.
- Emotional insight: Understanding the meaning behind emotions, including underlying needs and triggers from past experiences or patterns.

### Behavioral Anchoring

Each question references specific, observable behaviors rather than abstract concepts, making them easier to answer accurately and reducing interpretation bias.

### Progressive Difficulty

Questions move from basic mindfulness to sophisticated awareness skills, allowing the assessment to discriminate across the full range of mindfulness&self-awareness development.

### Practical Application

The openness-to-change dimension helps the AI consultant tailor recommendations to the user's current capacity and motivation level.
