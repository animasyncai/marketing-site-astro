## Evaluation Instructions

### Step 1: Calculate Self-Acceptance Score

Add up the scores from questions 1-9 only (exclude question 10 and attention check):

- Possible range: 9-36 points
- Higher scores indicate greater self-acceptance

### Step 2: Determine Self-Acceptance Level

Based on total score:

- **9 - 15 points**: Beginning Self-Acceptance
- **16 - 22 points**: Developing Self-Acceptance
- **23 - 29 points**: Growing Self-Acceptance
- **30 - 36 points**: Integrated Self-Acceptance

### Step 3: Determine Openness to Change

Based on Question 10 score:

- **1-2**: Resting Phase
- **3**: Mixed Feelings
- **4**: Ready to Grow
- **5**: Deep Exploration

### Step 4: Calculate Subscores

Subscores capture distinct behavioral dimensions within self-acceptance:

**innerVoice** = avg(SA3, SA4, SA5)

- Measures: Self-compassion vs. self-criticism, accepting imperfection
- Questions: Support during hard times, tone of inner voice, accepting weaknesses

**emotionalAcceptance** = avg(SA1, SA2, SA6)

- Measures: Allowing emotions without judgment or fixing
- Questions: Observing feelings, allowing unclear emotions, response to difficult emotions

**pastAcceptance** = avg(SA7, SA8)

- Measures: Accepting history and past mistakes
- Questions: Relationship to uncontrollable past events, forgiving past mistakes

**compassionForOthers** = SA9

- Measures: Extending acceptance outward
- Questions: Response to others' imperfections

**Metadata:**

- Score range: 1.0 - 4.0 (same as individual questions)
- Thresholds: LOW < 2.0 | MODERATE 2.0-3.0 | HIGH > 3.0
- Use: Enriches behavioral profiles with specific patterns (e.g., "accepts emotions but inner voice remains harsh")

## Questionnaire Design Rationale

### Comprehensive Coverage

The 9 core questions assess key self-acceptance dimensions:

1. Emotional awareness & nonjudgmental observation
2. Self-compassion & inner voice ( supportive vs. critical)
3. Acceptance of past & mistakes
4. Acceptance of others as a reflection of Self-Acceptance
5. Readiness for personal growth

### Behavioral Anchoring

Each question references specific, observable internal experiences rather than abstract concepts, making them easier to answer accurately and reducing interpretation bias.

### Progressive Development

Questions move from basic self-awareness to sophisticated self-acceptance skills, allowing the assessment to discriminate across the full range of self-acceptance development.

### Core Dimensions Assessed:

1. Emotional awareness & nonjudgmental observation: noticing emotions/feelings without judgment, allowing them to exist
2. Self-compassion & inner voice ( supportive vs. critical): treating oneself kindly, accepting imperfections
3. Acceptance of past & mistakes: acknowledging past events and mistakes without excessive blame
4. Acceptance of others as a reflection of Self-Acceptance: extending compassion outward, influenced by self-acceptance
5. Readiness for personal growth: motivation & empowerment for personal growth

### What It Doesn't Measure:

- Specific trauma responses
- Clinical depression or anxiety levels
- Detailed self-esteem patterns
- Perfectionism specifically
- Shame vs. guilt distinctions
