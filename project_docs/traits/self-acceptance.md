<user_report>
For user:

- Write a punchy, insightful reflection (150-200 words MAX - HARD LIMIT).
- Use markdown formatting.
- Create recognition without being pushy or using hard labels.

<tone_of_voice>
Use a **direct but not harsh, insightful but not judgmental tone**.

- Make specific observations about their inner dialogue and self-relationship
- Avoid labels about their "level" of self-acceptance
- Use descriptive language about how they treat themselves
- Be precise but emotionally safe
- Create recognition about their internal patterns
  </tone_of_voice>

- Start with how they relate to themselves:

  > "You [how they observe themselves] but [how they respond to what they see]."

- Focus on ONE core pattern about their self-relationship:
  - How they notice their emotions and reactions
  - The tone of their inner voice
  - How they handle self-criticism or difficult feelings about themselves

- Include a specific moment they'll recognize about their inner experience

- Show their current way of being with themselves without judgment:
  - What they can see about themselves vs. what feels unclear
  - How they respond to their own mistakes or struggles

- Use gentle, observational language:
  - "You tend to..." instead of "You are..."
  - "Part of you..." instead of "You always..."
  - "What you don't always notice..." instead of "What you can't see..."

- End subtly about their self-relationship:
  > "This is just one layer of how you [meet yourself/hear your inner voice/handle being human]."

**WORD COUNT: 150-200 words maximum. Focus on self-relationship recognition.**

<psychologist_notes>
For your own analysis as a psychologist:

- Assess using this structure:

**Self-Acceptance Level**: Total score and corresponding level without naming it to user

**Inner Dynamics Assessment**: - Emotional reflection ability (can they see deeper patterns?) - Self-observation capacity (inner witness development) - Relationship with difficult emotions - Dissociation vs. engagement levels

**Internal Balance**: - Masculine qualities (action, boundaries, direction) - Feminine qualities (receptivity, emotional openness, flow) - Integration level between these aspects

**Conversation Needs**: - How much emotional safety required - Appropriate level of challenge or insight - What supports their self-compassion vs. triggers self-criticism

**Development Stage**: Where they are in self-acceptance journey and what comes next

Write in practical terms for consultant guidance.

<interaction_approach>
Based on self-acceptance level: - Low acceptance: Prioritize safety and grounding. Avoid insight-pushing - Transitional: Validate small moments of awareness. Support inner witness development - Reflective: Encourage pattern recognition and gentle self-inquiry - Integrated: Support advanced emotional work and mentoring others

    Specific guidance:
    - If both inner aspects suppressed: Move very slowly, focus on reconnection
    - If inner conflict present: Hold contradictions without resolving
    - If one aspect blocked: Gently support the underdeveloped side
