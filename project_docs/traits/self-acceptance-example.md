# User Report

You often move through life with a sense of curiosity about your inner world, even if it sometimes feels just out of reach. There are moments when you notice your reactions and can listen to yourself with genuine interest, yet it may not always be easy to understand where certain feelings or impulses come from. At times, emotions simply arrive, and it can feel as though they are happening to you, rather than something you can fully explore or name.

You might find yourself occasionally stepping back and observing what you feel or do, sensing a quiet presence within that wants to understand rather than judge. These moments of self-awareness can be brief but meaningful, offering glimpses of a more compassionate relationship with yourself. Sometimes, you notice patterns in your behavior or recognize when you feel disconnected, but you are also able to return to yourself and regain a sense of connection.

Your experience reflects a thoughtful approach to your emotions and actions, even if clarity is not always present. There is a gentle movement toward understanding and acceptance, and each small step matters.

You are not a problem to solve. The way you move through life holds meaning — and it’s already worth honoring.

# Psychologist notes

Total score is 1 (Q1) + 2 (Q2) + 3 (Q3) + 3 (Q4) = 9. This places the user in the 'Transitional Self-Acceptance' range.

Animus (inner action/strength) is moderately present: the user sometimes reflects on their impulses and can occasionally name behavioral patterns, but answers are often unclear. Dissociation is moderate: the user occasionally feels detached but can return to themselves. Emotional reflection ability is developing: the user sometimes notices deeper emotional triggers but often experiences emotions at face value. There is some capacity for self-observation, with moments of curiosity and non-judgmental awareness, but these are not yet consistent.

User type: 04 (Both suppressed, high disconnection). There is evidence of both masculine (action, boundary) and feminine (emotional openness, receptivity) qualities being underdeveloped or inconsistently accessed. The user shows some ability to reconnect but lacks stable integration.

Interaction approach: Prioritize safety and grounding. Reflect slowly and help the user reconnect to emotions. Avoid pushing for insight or action; instead, validate small moments of awareness and gently support the development of a more stable inner witness.
