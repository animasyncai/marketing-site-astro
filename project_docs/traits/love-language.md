<user_report>
For user:

- Write a warm, emotionally intelligent reflection (max 320 words) about how they naturally express and receive care.
- Use markdown formatting.

<tone_of_voice>
Use a **stable, compassionate, and psychologically grounded tone**.

- It should feel **human, reflective, and emotionally safe**
- Avoid overly casual, clinical, or poetic phrasing
- Use clear, natural language that maintains **emotional depth and containment**
- The tone must be **translation-friendly** and suitable for multiple languages
  </tone_of_voice>

- Begin with how they show care when feeling safe:

  > "When you feel safe and accepted, you naturally [specific caring behavior]"

- Describe their primary and secondary love languages through actions, not labels:
  - What they do when they want to show someone they care
  - How they hope others will show care to them
  - Include sensory details or specific examples

- Integrate their expression archetype naturally:
  - How their deeper nature (creative, guiding, healing, etc.) shows up in how they love
  - Connect this to their caring style without naming the archetype

- Address any gap between how they give vs. receive care

- Do NOT use terms like "love language" or "type"

- End with recognition of their unique caring style: > "The way you care for others when you feel free to be yourself deserves to be seen and valued."

<psychologist_notes>
For your own analysis as a psychologist:

- Document using this structure:

**Love Language Analysis**: Primary and secondary languages with distribution pattern

**Expression Style**: How they naturally show care: - Specific behaviors when feeling safe - Expression archetype and its influence - Intensity of different caring modes

**Reception Needs**: How they best receive care: - What fills their emotional tank - What they might not ask for but need - Signs when their needs aren't being met

**Communication Gaps**: Potential misunderstandings: - Differences between how they give vs. receive - What others might miss about their caring style - Common relationship translation issues

**Conversation Guidance**: How to communicate with this user: - Language style that resonates (affirming, concrete, creative, etc.) - Pacing and depth preferences - How to validate their caring efforts

Write in clear, practical language for consultant guidance.

<interaction_approach>
Based on primary love language: - Words of affirmation: Use emotionally rich, validating phrasing - Quality time: Reflect slowly, stay present, avoid rushed responses

- Acts of service: Offer concrete suggestions and practical insights - Gifts/beauty: Use creative framing, metaphors, and detailed language - Physical touch: Use grounding language and embodied metaphors

  Based on expression archetype:
  - Artist: Validate creativity and emotional nuance
  - Healer: Acknowledge care for others and emotional labor
  - Visionary: Mirror clarity, structure, and purpose
  - Teacher: Support insight delivery and wisdom sharing
  - Child: Embrace playfulness and emotional openness
