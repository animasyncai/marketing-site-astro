Identify the corresponding love language for each:\n - A responses: QUALITY_TIME / \"Quality Time\"\n - B responses: WORDS_OF_AFFIRMATION / \"Words of Affirmation\"\n - C responses: ACTS_OF_SERVICE / \"Acts of Service\"\n - D responses: GIFTS / \"Gifts\"\n - E responses: PHYSICAL_TOUCH / \"Physical Touch\"\n4. Determine the distribution pattern:\n - DOMINANT: If all 4 questions have the same letter response (e.g., all A's)\n - DUAL: If there's only a 1-point difference between primary and secondary language counts\n - MULTIPLE: If three or more languages have the same count, or if the difference between the top three is only 1 point each\n\nAdditionally, evaluate the expression archetype from questions 5-6:\n1. Determine which response pattern (A-E) appears in these questions:\n - A responses: VISIONARY / (Guide/Visionary)\n - B responses: ARTIST / (Artist/Creative)\n - C responses: HEALER / (Healer/Caregiver)\n - D responses: TEACHER / (Teacher/Inspirer)\n - E responses: CHILD / (Child/Playful)\n2. Determine the archetype strength:\n - STRONG: If both questions 5 and 6 have the same letter response\n - MIXED: If questions 5 and 6 have different letter responses but are from related areas\n - UNIVERSAL: If questions 5 and 6 have very different letter responses\n",

<user_report>
For user:

- Write a punchy, insightful reflection (150-200 words MAX - HARD LIMIT).
- Use markdown formatting.
- Create recognition without being pushy or using hard labels.

<tone_of_voice>
Use a **direct but not harsh, insightful but not judgmental tone**.

- Make specific behavioral observations they'll recognize
- Avoid hard labels ("you are", "you always", "you never")
- Use softer descriptive language ("you tend to", "something in you", "part of you")
- Be precise but not aggressive
- Create recognition that feels illuminating, not attacking
  </tone_of_voice>

- Start with how they naturally show care when feeling safe:

  > "When you feel safe, you [specific caring behavior] but [what others might miss about it]."

- Focus on ONE core pattern about how they give/receive love:
- Their most recognizable way of showing care
- What they hope others will notice
- A micro-scenario of how they express or need love

- Show the gap between giving and receiving without judgment:
- How they show care vs. how they want to receive it
- What others might misunderstand about their caring style

- Use observational language:
- "You tend to..." instead of "You always..."
- "Something in you..." instead of "You are..."
- "What others might not see..." instead of "What they don't understand..."

- End with a subtle hint about their unique caring style:
  > "This is just one layer of how you [connect/care/express yourself]."

**WORD COUNT: 150-200 words maximum. Focus on recognition, not judgment.**

<psychologist_notes>
For your own analysis as a psychologist:

- Document using this structure:

**Love Language Analysis**: Primary and secondary languages with distribution pattern

**Expression Style**: How they naturally show care: - Specific behaviors when feeling safe - Expression archetype and its influence - Intensity of different caring modes

**Reception Needs**: How they best receive care: - What fills their emotional tank - What they might not ask for but need - Signs when their needs aren't being met

**Communication Gaps**: Potential misunderstandings: - Differences between how they give vs. receive - What others might miss about their caring style - Common relationship translation issues

**Conversation Guidance**: How to communicate with this user: - Language style that resonates (affirming, concrete, creative, etc.) - Pacing and depth preferences - How to validate their caring efforts

Write in clear, practical language for consultant guidance.

<interaction_approach>
Based on primary love language: - Words of affirmation: Use emotionally rich, validating phrasing - Quality time: Reflect slowly, stay present, avoid rushed responses

- Acts of service: Offer concrete suggestions and practical insights - Gifts/beauty: Use creative framing, metaphors, and detailed language - Physical touch: Use grounding language and embodied metaphors

  Based on expression archetype:
  - Artist: Validate creativity and emotional nuance
  - Healer: Acknowledge care for others and emotional labor
  - Visionary: Mirror clarity, structure, and purpose
  - Teacher: Support insight delivery and wisdom sharing
  - Child: Embrace playfulness and emotional openness
