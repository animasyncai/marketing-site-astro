# Evaluation

Here are the updated evaluation instructions for Love Language:

## **Question Structure**

- **3 questions total**, each with 9 options
- **Options 1-8** are divided into 4 love language categories with A/B subtypes
- **Option 9** is Physical Touch (no subtypes)

## **Step 1: Calculate Subtype Scores**

For each love language category, calculate separate average scores for subtype A and B:

### **Quality Time**

- **A (Shared activities/presence):** Average of Q1-opt1, Q2-opt1, Q3-opt1
- **B (Focused attention/listening):** Average of Q1-opt2, Q2-opt2, Q3-opt2

### **Words of Affirmation**

- **A (Meaningful conversations):** Average of Q1-opt3, Q2-opt3, Q3-opt3
- **B (Words of affection/encouragement):** Average of Q1-opt4, Q2-opt4, Q3-opt4

### **Acts of Service**

- **A (Support when needed):** Average of Q1-opt5, Q2-opt5, Q3-opt5
- **B (Taking over responsibilities):** Average of Q1-opt6, Q2-opt6, Q3-opt6

### **Receiving Gifts**

- **A (Valuable/precious gifts):** Average of Q1-opt7, Q2-opt7, Q3-opt7
- **B (Small surprises/tokens):** Average of Q1-opt8, Q2-opt8, Q3-opt8

### **Physical Touch**

- **No subtypes:** Average of Q1-opt9, Q2-opt9, Q3-opt9

---

## **Step 2: Calculate Overall Love Language Scores**

For each category (except Physical Touch):

1. **Overall Score** = (Score_A + Score_B) / 2
2. **Intensity Level** based on overall score:
   - **1.0–2.0:** LOW (least favorable)
   - **2.1–3.0:** MILD (somewhat favorable)
   - **3.1–4.0:** MODERATE (moderately favorable)
   - **4.1–5.0:** HIGH (most favorable)

For Physical Touch:

- **Overall Score** = average of all 3 responses
- Same intensity mapping applies

---

## **Step 3: Determine Subtype Dominance**

For each love language with subtypes, determine which flavor is dominant:

### **Subtype Calculation**

difference = |Score_A - Score_B| If difference ≤ 0.5: subtype = "BALANCED" If Score_A > Score_B by >0.5: subtype = "A" If Score_B > Score_A by >0.5: subtype = "B"

### **What This Means**

- **BALANCED:** No clear preference between A and B
- **A-dominant:** Clearly prefers the A flavor of this love language
- **B-dominant:** Clearly prefers the B flavor of this love language

**Example:**

- Quality Time overall: 4.2 (HIGH)
  - A (Shared activities): 3.5
  - B (Focused attention): 4.9
  - Difference: 1.4 → **Subtype B** (prefers focused attention over shared activities)

---

## **Step 4: Rank Love Languages**

1. Sort all 5 love languages by overall score (descending)
2. **Primary Love Language** = highest overall score
3. **Secondary Love Language** = second highest overall score (if exists)

---

## **Step 5: Determine Distribution Pattern**

Based on the relationship between primary and secondary scores:

### **DOMINANT**

- Primary score ≥ 4.0 **AND**
- Gap between primary and secondary ≥ 1.5

**Meaning:** Clear, strong preference for one love language

### **DUAL**

- Difference between primary and secondary ≤ 0.5

**Meaning:** Two love languages matter almost equally

### **MULTIPLE**

- Top 3 scores all within 1.0 of each other

**Meaning:** Flexible, can feel loved through multiple approaches

### **Default**

If none of the above apply → **DUAL** (if secondary exists) or **DOMINANT** (if no secondary)
