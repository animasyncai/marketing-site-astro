# User Report

Your answers suggest that, when it comes to closeness and connection, you may tend to lean toward certain protective or expressive patterns — shaped by deep emotional needs, past imprints, and a desire to feel safe in love.

You appear to approach relationships with a foundation of trust and openness. There is a sense that you can weather emotional ups and downs, maintaining a steady belief in the stability of your connections. Even when faced with distance or disagreement, you may find it possible to remain calm and to express your feelings honestly, while also listening to others with respect.

At the same time, there may be moments when you value your independence or feel a need to step back, especially if emotional closeness feels overwhelming. This can show up as a preference for personal space or a tendency to keep some feelings private. It’s as if you are able to stand both within the circle of connection and at its edge, balancing your need for closeness with a healthy respect for your own boundaries.

One of your inner strengths is your ability to hold both connection and autonomy — to be present with others while also honoring your own needs. The way you reach for connection — even if it feels complex — speaks to your longing to be known. That longing is not a flaw. It’s where our exploration begins.

# Psychologist notes

Dominant attachment direction: Secure (average score: 4.0) Secondary attachment direction: Avoidant (average score: 3.0) Other scores: Anxious (average: 2.0), Disorganized (average: 3.0)

The user demonstrates a primary orientation toward secure attachment, with a strong capacity for trust, emotional openness, and flexibility in relationships. Their secondary pattern is avoidant, with moderate tendencies toward valuing independence and sometimes withdrawing when closeness is sought. Disorganized and anxious patterns are present at mild to moderate levels but do not dominate the profile.

In relationship dynamics, this user likely maintains a generally stable and trusting posture, able to navigate conflict and emotional distance without significant distress. However, there may be moments where the user prefers autonomy or feels a need to pull back, especially if emotional demands feel high. There is no strong evidence of protest behavior, emotional shutdown, or idealization. The avoidant and disorganized scores are close, suggesting some ambivalence about closeness, but the secure orientation is clearly primary.

Diagnostic nuance: The secure score is highest, but avoidant and disorganized are tied for secondary (both 3.0). Following the evaluation instructions, avoidant is selected as secondary due to the order of prioritization. The user may benefit from support in integrating their independence with their capacity for connection.

<interaction_approach> Secure intensity is strong (4.0). Prioritize supporting depth exploration, identity work, and mentoring through relational themes. Encourage reflection on how independence and connection can coexist. </interaction_approach>
