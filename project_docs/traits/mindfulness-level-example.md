# User Report

You seem to notice some of your internal experiences, such as emotions or physical sensations, though it may not always be consistent or clear where these signals are leading you. There is a sense of curiosity about your inner world, and at times you are able to process emotions with understanding. However, dedicating regular time to mindfulness or self-reflection may still feel sporadic or challenging to maintain.

When it comes to personal change, you appear to be in a place of wanting something to shift, yet there may be some uncertainty about how to begin or what steps to take. This is a natural and valid place to be—change often starts with a mix of hope and hesitation. You may be open to trying small, manageable steps if they feel emotionally safe and supportive.

The fact that you’re paying attention is already a doorway. You don’t have to rush — awareness begins with noticing.

# Psychologist notes

Mindfulness score total: 8 (Q1: 2, Q2: 4, Q3: 2). This places the user in the "Budimo taškas" range, indicating a low to moderate level of mindfulness. The user demonstrates some curiosity and partial awareness of their internal states, but their engagement with mindfulness practices is inconsistent and lacks structure.

Openness to change score: 3. This suggests the user is ambivalent—there is a desire for change and a willingness to try small steps, but also some uncertainty or hesitation. The user may benefit from clarity, gentle support, and emotionally safe invitations rather than structured or intensive interventions.

The user's current awareness level provides a foundation for growth, but their motivation is not fully aligned with deep change. There is enough curiosity and self-reflection to begin exploring new practices, but the approach should remain gentle and non-demanding. The user may respond best to simple, grounding reflections and small, emotionally safe invitations to further self-awareness, rather than intensive or transformational work at this stage.
