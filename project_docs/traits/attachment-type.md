### Evaluation Instructions

### Step 1: Calculate Average Scores

For each attachment style, add up the three question scores and divide by 3:

- **Anxious Average** = (Question 1 + Question 2 + Question 3) ÷ 3
- **Avoidant Average** = (Question 4 + Question 5 + Question 6) ÷ 3
- **Disorganized Average** = (Question 7 + Question 8 + Question 9) ÷ 3
- **Secure Average** = (Question 10 + Question 11 + Question 12) ÷ 3

### Step 2: Determine Primary Type

The attachment style with the highest average score is the primary type.

### Step 3: Determine Secondary Type

The attachment style with the second highest average score is the secondary type.

### Step 4: Calculate Intensity Levels

Based on the average score:

- **1.0-2.0**: Very Mild (minimal traits)
- **2.1-3.0**: Mild (low-moderate expression)
- **3.1-4.0**: Moderate (noticeable traits)
- **4.1-5.0**: Strong (highly pronounced traits)

### Step 5: Handle Close Scores

When scores are very close (within 0.3 points):

- If Secure is tied with another style, prioritize the non-Secure style as primary
- If two non-Secure styles are tied, use the higher intensity as primary
- For exact ties, prioritize in this order: Disorganized > Anxious > Avoidant > Secure

### Step 6: Validate Response Quality

- Check for straight-lining (all answers the same value) - if detected, flag as potentially invalid
- If flagged as invalid, suggest retaking the assessment
