# Features Overview

This section describes all features and their working principles in Withinly project.

## Traits

Traits are used to understand users emotional and psichological picture. They consist of short questionairres which are then evaluated and used to genenerate insights for the user, AI consultant and reports.

Currently we have 4 traits:

- Love language
- Attachment type
- Mindfulness level
- Self acceptance level

While all of these are very distinct and our questionairres identify primary values, like for example primaryLoveLanguage: touch - we avoid any labels. It's in the nature of our product to encompass these things into story telling and avoiding labeling people as they tend to fixate.

Each trait produces short user facing report and thing we call 'psychologistNotes' which is then used by the AI consultant to enable it to go deeper and more personal into reflection together with the user. The generation of this information and evaluation of queastionairres is done by a prompt.

We might add more traits as we go and expand our report base or functionality. For now it seems solid to have 4 traits.

### Love language

Main goal of the trait is to identify primary and secondary love languages and their lovers archetype.

User facing title: The way You love
Description: none, need to generate (displayed when trait not done)

Main prompt: `/traits/love-language.md`
Example output: `/traits/love-language-example.md`

### Attachment type

Main goal of the trait is to identify identify primary and secondary attachment types

User facing title: The way You attach
Description: none, need to generate (displayed when trait not done)

Main prompt: `/traits/attachment-type.md`
Example output: `/traits/attachment-type-example.md`

### Mindfulness level

Main goal of the trait is to identify mindfulness level of the user.

User facing title: The Way You Stay Present
Description: none, need to generate (displayed when trait not done)

Main prompt: `/traits/mindfulness-level.md`
Example output: `/traits/mindfulness-level-example.md`

### Self acceptance level

Main goal of the trait is to identify how users accepts one self and what kind of narrative might live in his/her head.

User facing title: The Way You Hear Yourself
Description: none, need to generate (displayed when trait not done)

Main prompt: `/traits/self-acceptance.md`
Example output: `/traits/self-acceptance-example.md`

Other notes:

- The user report from trait is showed only first time when trait is done.
- Second time when trait is done we have evaluation wether main traits have changed. If traits changed we flag the trait as changed. Then we can flag associated reports as recommended to regenerate.
- The logic for change evaluation is in `/prompts/trait-evaluation.md`

## Reports aka Inner Portrait

- Trait-based 1000-1500 word reports
- Each report requires certain traits to be done, they can be generated only if all required traits are done. They can be generated in any order.
- All reports are generated by AI based on prompts and data from traits (psychologistNotes) and questionairre answers.
- Each report costs tokens to generate
- Each report works standalone (no cross-referencing for cost efficiency)
- Each report generates AI consultant ready 200 word summary of the report for later use in chat (if needed)
- You can read more on reports in `information-architecture.md`

## Chat Assistant aka Reflection Companion

- Emotionally-aware AI chat for personal reflection
- Adapts tone and guidance based on user traits (uses psychologistNotes)
- Summarizes chat and extracts significant notes, but that is currently experimental. Prompt `/prompts/summarizeAntExtract.md`
- Token-metered conversation length
- Has access to report summarization via tool-based system (200 word summary of the report) - `/prompts/tool-report-summary.md`
- Main prompt `prompts/consultant.md` example with real data: `prompts/consultant-example.md`

Thoughts:

- Currently not performing that well and can be hacked to output labeled and structured data. Need improvement.
- While not limiting input, we think we should limit output length sometimes. Like it should only write long output if situation requires it - deep meaningful reflection or guidance - otherwise - meaning over word count. Not sure how to implement.
- Not sure how to price it yet.

## Tools

- Goal-setting and growth-oriented practices (planned)
- Vibe tracker and emotional pulse (planned)
- Longitudinal insight graphs (future feature)
