# Opening Hook

## Do these feel familiar?

- You pull away when someone needs closeness
- You give advice when comfort was needed
- Small fights feel outsized
- You wonder if you're too much — or not enough

Withinly turns these patterns into words you can use — no labels, no quick fixes, just clear recognition.

> "It's not about what's wrong with you. It's about understanding what makes sense about you."

# FAQ Section

### Is this therapy?

No. Withinly is a reflection tool — like a mirror for your patterns. It’s about recognition, not treatment. If you’re in crisis, please seek professional help.

Perfect. Understanding yourself before your next relationship is one of the best ways to grow. You don’t need a partner to use Withinly.

---

### How private is this?

Your reflections stay yours. Even in partner sync, only shared insights are visible — never your private answers or chats.

---

### How much does it cost?

Starting reflections are free. If you want to go deeper, you’ll use **Sparks** (credits). In beta, pricing is flexible while we learn from users — you won’t have to commit to subscriptions.

# Additional Sections for Later

## For Specific Audiences

### If you're in therapy

Use Withinly insights to go deeper in sessions. Many therapists love when clients bring this kind of self-awareness to their work together.

### If you're dating

Understand your patterns before they become relationship patterns. Know what you need and how you naturally show care.

### If you keep having the same fights

See the cycle you're both stuck in. Most conflict isn't about the thing you're fighting about — it's about the pattern underneath.

---

## Product Positioning

### Not like other apps because:

- **Therapy apps**: Try to treat or fix you
- **Dating apps**: Focus on matching, not understanding
- **Personality tests**: Give you a category, not insight
- **Meditation apps**: Focus on calm, not patterns

### Withinly: Understands the emotional patterns that shape your relationships

## Later FAQ

## Common questions

**Is this therapy?**  
No. It's a reflection tool that helps you see your patterns clearly. If you need clinical support, work with a therapist.

**What if I'm single?**  
Perfect timing. Understanding your patterns now helps you choose better and show up differently in your next relationship.

**How is this different from personality tests?**  
Tests sort you into types. Withinly shows you how you actually move—through conflict, closeness, care, and self-talk. You get behavioral patterns you'll recognize, not categories that limit you.

**What about my privacy?**  
Everything stays private. Even with partner sync, only shared insights are visible—never your individual patterns or conversations.

**Can this replace therapy?**  
No. If you're in crisis or dealing with serious mental health challenges, seek professional help. This is for reflection, not treatment.

**Why don't I get my attachment type or love language?**  
Because you deserve more than a label. You'll get specific behaviors you'll actually recognize—when they happen, why they make sense, and how they shape your relationships. Labels reduce. Patterns reveal.

## Using Withinly // Portal FAQ

**How do Sparks work?**  
Sparks unlock steps. Traits and basic reports cost 1 Spark. Premium reports cost 3 Sparks. Chat costs 1 Spark for 20 messages (Standard mode) or 5 messages (Depth mode). You start with 5 free Sparks.

**Can I retake traits?**  
Yes, after 30 days. First take is free; retakes cost 1 Spark. Patterns shift as you grow—retaking shows what's changed.

**I want to know my attachment type. Where is it?**  
You won't find labels here—and that's intentional. Labels like "anxious" or "words of affirmation" lock you into categories. Your actual experience is more fluid.

Instead, your reports describe specific behaviors: when you withdraw, what makes you feel safe, how stress changes how you connect. That's what actually helps you understand yourself and talk to partners or therapists.

If you need research terms for context: Independence and withdrawal → "avoidant." Reassurance-seeking → "anxious." Push-pull dynamics → "disorganized." But the behavioral details matter more than the category name.

**How do I share reports?**  
Don't send the whole report—it's too much. Screenshot 1-2 sections that matter most and share those. For therapy, bring specific parts that connect to what you're working on.

**What if my report doesn't make sense?**  
Ask your Reflection Companion. It knows your patterns and can help you explore what specific sections mean for your life.

**Can my partner see my traits?**  
Not unless you explicitly share. Partner sync only reveals combined insights—never your individual data or conversations.
