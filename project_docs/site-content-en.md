# Opening Hook

## Do these feel familiar?

- You pull away when someone needs closeness
- You give advice when comfort was needed
- Small fights feel outsized
- You wonder if you're too much — or not enough

Withinly turns these patterns into words you can use — no labels, no quick fixes, just clear recognition.

> "It's not about what's wrong with you. It's about understanding what makes sense about you."

# FAQ Section

## Common questions

**Is this therapy?**
No. Think of it as a mirror that helps you see your patterns more clearly. It draws on frameworks like attachment theory and love languages, but instead of boxing you into labels, it translates them into personal reflections you can actually feel and use.

**What if I'm single?**
Perfect. Understanding your patterns before your next relationship is incredibly valuable — it helps you choose better and show up differently.

**How is this different from personality tests?**
Tests give you a type. Withinly gives you a reflection — living narratives about how you show up in conflict, in closeness, and in how you love.

**What about my privacy?**
Everything stays private. Even with partner sync, only shared insights are visible — never your individual patterns or conversations.

**Can this replace therapy?**
No. If you're in crisis or dealing with serious mental-health challenges, please seek professional help. Withinly is for self-understanding, not treatment.

# Additional Sections for Later

## For Specific Audiences

### If you're in therapy

Use Withinly insights to go deeper in sessions. Many therapists love when clients bring this kind of self-awareness to their work together.

### If you're dating

Understand your patterns before they become relationship patterns. Know what you need and how you naturally show care.

### If you keep having the same fights

See the cycle you're both stuck in. Most conflict isn't about the thing you're fighting about — it's about the pattern underneath.

## Product Positioning

### Not like other apps because:

- **Therapy apps**: Try to treat or fix you
- **Dating apps**: Focus on matching, not understanding
- **Personality tests**: Give you a category, not insight
- **Meditation apps**: Focus on calm, not patterns

### Withinly: Understands the emotional patterns that shape your relationships
