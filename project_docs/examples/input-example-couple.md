Can observe patterns when reminded or during calm moments but loses this capacity under stress. Inner critic still dominant but occasionally challenged by compassionate self-talk. Shows genuine curiosity about inner world. Benefits from practices that strengthen the observer self and reduce self-judgment. Needs validation that developing self-acceptance is a process with natural fluctuations. Actively motivated for change with clear readiness. Can engage with structured practices and goal-setting. Benefits from concrete suggestions and accountability. Energy available for consistent effort. Good time for introducing regular practices and deeper self-inquiry."},"loveLanguage":{"primary":"QUALITY_TIME","secondary":"PHYSICAL_TOUCH","distribution":"DUAL","primaryScore":4.3,"secondaryScore":4.3,"primaryScores":{"A":{"score":4,"label":"Shared activities/presence"},"B":{"score":4.7,"label":"Focused attention/listening"}},"allScores":{"qualityTime":{"overall":4.3,"scores":{"A":{"score":4,"label":"Shared activities/presence"},"B":{"score":4.7,"label":"Focused attention/listening"}}},"wordsOfAffirmation":{"overall":4.2,"scores":{"A":{"score":4.3,"label":"Meaningful conversations"},"B":{"score":4,"label":"Words of affection/encouragement"}}},"actsOfService":{"overall":4,"scores":{"A":{"score":4,"label":"Support when needed"},"B":{"score":4,"label":"Taking over responsibilities"}}},"gifts":{"overall":2,"scores":{"A":{"score":1.3,"label":"Valuable/precious gifts"},"B":{"score":2.7,"label":"Small surprises/tokens"}}},"physicalTouch":{"overall":4.3}},"maxScore":5},"attachmentType":{"primary":"AVOIDANT","secondary":"SECURE","primaryIntensity":"MODERATE","secondaryIntensity":"MODERATE","maxScore":5,"primaryScore":4,"secondaryScore":3.7,"allScores":{"anxious":1.7,"avoidant":4,"disorganized":1.3,"secure":3.7},"behavioralProfile":"Generally comfortable with independence but can engage emotionally when not feeling pressured.
