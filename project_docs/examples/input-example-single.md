      "behavioralProfile": "Developing self-reflective abilities with inconsistent application. Can observe patterns when reminded or during calm moments but loses this capacity under stress. Inner critic still dominant but occasionally challenged by compassionate self-talk. Shows genuine curiosity about inner world. Benefits from practices that strengthen the observer self and reduce self-judgment. Needs validation that developing self-acceptance is a process with natural fluctuations. Actively motivated for change with clear readiness. Can engage with structured practices and goal-setting. Benefits from concrete suggestions and accountability. Energy available for consistent effort. Good time for introducing regular practices and deeper self-inquiry."
