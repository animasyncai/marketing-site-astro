# Withinly

Withinly is an AI-powered self-discovery and emotional insight tool. It helps users explore their inner world, relationship patterns, and personal growth areas through structured assessments and AI-generated reports.

## Key Features

- In-depth psychological questionnaires (e.g., Attachment, Self-Acceptance)
- AI-generated narrative reports and summaries
- Emotionally intelligent conversation/chat assistant
- Relationship simulations & partner reflections
- Token-based economy for usage control

## How It Works

1. User completes structured psychological assessments that we call traits.
2. Based on trait questionairre AI generates two layers of insight. A public facing 300 word report and "psychologist notes" that serve as guidance to the AI consultant later on. In addition it saves a trait value like primaryLoveLanguage: touch and so on. 
3. User can then interact with a AI Consultant for ongoing self-reflection. The 
4. Reports and chat usage are unlocked with tokens.

## Business Model

- **Token-based** pricing
- Users buy token packs to access reports and chat
- Optional low-tier monthly plans offer recurring token bundles
- Higher usage = higher spend; cost matched to value received
