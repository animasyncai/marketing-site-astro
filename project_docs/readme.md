# Withinly

Withinly is an AI-powered reflection tool about **connections and patterns**.  
It helps you see yourself more clearly ‚Äî both on your own and through your relationships.

At its heart: we are mirrors of each other.  
By exploring your traits and how they meet in connection, Withinly gives you emotionally intelligent insights you can return to and grow with.

## ‚ú® What It Does

- **Discover your traits**: short questionnaires that map how you attach, love, stay present, and accept yourself.
- **Receive reports**: from a gentle _Inner Portrait_ to deeper guides like the _Conflict Compass_ or _Relationship Blueprint_.
- **Reflect with an AI consultant**: an emotionally aware presence that adapts to your patterns, helping you see connections you might miss.
- **Sync with a partner**: share a _Couple Snapshot_ or unlock premium couple reports to understand where you align, differ, and how you can reconnect.
