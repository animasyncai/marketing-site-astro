THIS IS JUST A DRAFT, DO NOT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY

# Token System

Business model based on token usage for AI-generated content and interactions.
Reports generated by AI. Chat powered by psychologically-informed models.

## MODEL STRATEGY

**Multi-model optimization for cost and quality:**

- **Premium functions**: GPT-5 or Claude Sonnet (trait evaluations, premium reports)
- **Standard functions**: GPT-5 (basic reports, chat)
- **Commodity functions**: GPT-5 mini (translations)

## CURRENT COSTS TO US

**Primary Models:**

- GPT-5: $1.25 per 1M input tokens / $10 per 1M output tokens
- Claude Sonnet 4: $3 per 1M input tokens / $15 per 1M output tokens
- GPT-5 mini: $0.25 per 1M input tokens / $2 per 1M output tokens

**Function-Specific Costs (GPT-5 uniform):**

- Trait evaluation: $0.008 (GPT-5, ~3000 input / ~700 output tokens)
- Basic report: $0.008 (GPT-5, ~3500 input / ~1200 output tokens)
- Chat message with context: $0.0055 (GPT-5, see context breakdown below)
- Translation: $0.0005 (GPT-5 mini)

**Infrastructure:** $0.05 per user per month

**Context overhead breakdown:**

- Base message: ~200 tokens input + ~150 tokens output
- System prompt: ~1000 tokens (loaded each message)
- Conversation summary: ~500 tokens input + ~100 tokens output (every 3-5 messages)
- **Total cost per chat message: $0.0055**

**Free user cost scenarios:**

**Recommended free tier:**

- 4 trait evaluations: 4 Sparkss ($0.032 cost)
- 1 basic report: 1 Sparks ($0.008 cost)
- 50 chat messages: 5 Sparkss ($0.275 cost)
- Infrastructure: $0.05
- **Total cost: $0.365 per free user/month**
- **Total Sparks given free: 10 Sparks**

**Sparks pack pricing for sustainability:**

- **Target margin**: 1000-1500% markup (industry standard for freemium)
- **Sparks price**: $0.10 per Sparks
- **Math**: $0.008 avg cost → $0.10 price = 12.5x margin
- **Rationale**: High margin needed to subsidize free users + platform costs

**Free tier economics:**

- **Cost per free user**: $0.365/month
- **Value given**: 10 Sparkss ($1.00 retail value)
- **Required conversion**: 1 in 3 free users must spend $1+/month for sustainability

## TOKEN PRICING

| Feature          | Sparks Cost | Real AI Cost | AI Tokens Used         | Cost Ratio    |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| Trait Evaluation | 1 Sparks    | $0.008       | ~3700 GPT-5 tokens     | 1x baseline   |
| Basic Report     | 1 Sparks    | $0.008       | ~4700 GPT-5 tokens     | 1x baseline   |
| Chat Message     | 0.1 Sparks  | $0.0055      | ~1800 GPT-5 tokens     | 0.7x baseline |
| Translation      | FREE        | $0.0005      | ~200 GPT-5 mini tokens | Absorbed cost |
| Partner Sync     | 3 Sparkss   | $0.024       | ~8000 GPT-5 tokens     | 3x baseline   |
| Partner Report   | 2 Sparkss   | $0.016       | ~6000 GPT-5 tokens     | 2x baseline   |

**Sparks pricing logic:**

- **Baseline**: 1 Sparks = ~$0.008 in AI costs
- **Chat optimized**: 10 messages = 1 Sparks (reasonable for conversations)
- **Value perception**: Reports feel substantial vs chat messages
- **Translation**: Free to remove friction (minimal cost)

**Token pack pricing for sustainability:**

- **Target margin**: 400-500% markup to cover free users + profit
- **Suggested token price**: $0.04 per token
- **Rationale**: $0.008 cost → $0.04 price = 5x margin to subsidize free users

**Free tier economics:**

- **Monthly cost per free user**: $0.20-0.26
- **Required paid user ratio**: 1 paid user must cover 4-5 free users
- **Conversion target**: 20-25% of users must convert to paid

## TOKEN PACKS

**Pricing strategy**: Cover AI costs + infrastructure + 60% margin minimum.

_Specific pack pricing to be determined based on user behavior data._

**Pricing considerations:**

- Basic tier: Essential psychological insights (GPT-5 quality)
- Premium tier: Superior emotional depth (Claude quality)
- Volume discounts: Encourage deeper platform engagement

## COST OPTIMIZATION RATIONALE

**Foundation protection**: Trait evaluations use premium models - these drive all subsequent interactions and reports. Quality here affects entire user experience.

**Value differentiation**: Two-tier reports allow users to choose between cost-effective insights and premium psychological depth.

**Smart cost allocation**:

- High frequency, low complexity: Optimized models (translations, simple processing)
- Low frequency, high impact: Premium models (trait evaluations, deep reports)
- Medium frequency, medium complexity: Balanced models (chat, basic reports)

**Risk mitigation**: Multi-model approach reduces dependency on single provider pricing or availability.

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Token system aligns costs with usage while enabling:

- Premium psychological accuracy where it matters most
- Cost efficiency on commodity functions
- Quality differentiation through model selection
- Scalable pricing that grows with user engagement

**Key insight**: Optimize costs on periphery, invest in psychological foundation quality.

# UX CONSIDERATIONS AROUND SPARKS:

1. After successful report generation user needs to receive feedback message identifying success and telling how much sparks are left.
   Ex. Report has been generated. [X] ✨ Sparks remaining.
2. After unsuccessful report generation user needs to receive feedback message identifying failure and telling that sparks have not been deducted.
   Ex. There was a mistake - [ERROR]. Report has not been generated. Sparks have not been deducted. [X] ✨ Sparks remaining.
3. Sparks balance is always visible in the left sidebar above profile. "You have [X] Sparks"
   3.1 Clicking on it opens a modal with the following content:
   {TODO WRITE DOWN THE CONTENT OF THE MODAL}
   3.2 Every time sparks are deducted, the balance is updated and the spark pulses (animation).
   3.3 If balance is < 3 sparks - it changes color
4. Sparks balance is always visible in the profile itself.
5. If sparks are < 3 we start showing a notification box (which can be turned off - local storage) that says..
   5.1 {TODO WRITE DOWN THE CONTENT OF THE NOTIFICATION BOX}
6. If sparks are 0 show a notificion box (not togglable) that says...
   Time to Refill Sparks ✨
   You've used all your Sparks exploring your patterns. Ready to go deeper?
   [Get more Sparks ✨]
7. In settings show a breakdown of sparks usage (Recent activity). A simple table with the following columns: - Feature (Chat - [X messages], Report - [Name], Trait - [Name]) - Cost - Date
   7.1 Group chat events together if they happen one after another
