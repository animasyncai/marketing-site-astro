# JTBD (Jobs To Be Done)

The goal of this document is to frame value in terms of what users actually “hire” Withinly to do.

---

## ✅ Primary Job

**"Help me understand the emotional patterns that shape how I connect — with myself and with others — so I can recognize myself more clearly and build better relationships."**

This is the emotional core.  
Users want **clarity and recognition**.  
Not “what am I?” but “why do I act this way?”  
Not “how do we match?” but “how can we truly meet each other better?”

---

## 🧠 Functional Jobs

- Reveal **how I connect** (attachment, love language, mindfulness, self-acceptance)
- Show me **my recurring patterns** in conflict, closeness, and self-talk
- Generate **personal narratives** that help me recognize myself
- Offer a safe **AI reflection space** that adapts to my patterns
- Let me **see my relationship through patterns**, not judgments (Couple Snapshot, Relationship Compass)
- Allow me to **return later** and see if my patterns shifted
- Provide clarity without requiring therapy or oversimplified quizzes

---

## 💓 Emotional Jobs

- Help me **feel seen and understood**, even in messy or contradictory parts of myself
- Reassure me that I am **not broken** — just patterned
- Let me explore my inner world **without judgment or labels**
- Give me words I can use with a partner, friend, or therapist
- Show me that **connection is possible**, even when it feels difficult
- Create a sense of **safety**: my reflections are mine, private, and not exposed

---

## 🧲 Desired Outcomes

- **Language** to explain myself and my needs (to a partner or therapist)
- More **awareness of conflict patterns** and how I return to balance
- Clarity on what kind of love and connection helps me feel safe
- **Recognition of blind spots** that repeat in relationships
- A sense of progress: seeing **patterns evolve** over time
- Confidence that I am growing in how I connect, not just coping

## 📦 Competing Alternatives

When someone is trying to “do” this job, what else might they hire?

| Alternative                                | Strengths              | Weaknesses Compared to Withinly   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Therapy (talk or couples)                  | Deep, personal         | Expensive, slow, risk of judgment |
| Books/workbooks on attachment, etc.        | Informative, low cost  | Generic, not personalized         |
| Personality quizzes (e.g. 16personalities) | Quick, fun             | Shallow, overly labeled           |
| Journaling / reflection tools              | Private, flexible      | Unguided, no feedback             |
| Meditation / mindfulness apps              | Emotionally regulating | Not insight-driven                |

Withinly sits between **therapy-level reflection** and **accessible tools**:  
personalized, emotionally intelligent insights — without judgment or oversimplification.
