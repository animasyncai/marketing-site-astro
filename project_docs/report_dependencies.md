# Report Dependencies & Generation Rules

## Trait Requirements

**3 Core Traits (Required for basic functionality):**

- Attachment Type
- Mindfulness Level
- Self-Acceptance Level

**Optional 4th Trait:**

## Report Generation Rules

1. **Reports only generate when ALL required traits are complete**
2. **Regeneration recommended when trait scores change significantly**
3. **Each report is standalone** - no cross-referencing for cost efficiency
4. **Regeneration costs full price** - same AI processing as new generation
