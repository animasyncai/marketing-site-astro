# Report Dependencies & Generation Rules

## Report Generation Rules

1. **Reports only generate when ALL required traits are complete**
2. **Regeneration recommended when trait scores change significantly**
3. **Each report is standalone** - no cross-referencing for cost efficiency
4. **Regeneration costs full price** - same AI processing as new generation

## Report Access in Chat (PROBABLY NOT IN MVP)

- AI consultant can access purchased reports via tool-based system
- Uses 200-word behavioral summaries, not full reports
- Only accesses when contextually relevant to conversation
- Natural integration without mechanical references

## Couple Report Regeneration Rules

When either partner's traits change significantly:

- Both personalized couple reports are marked for regeneration
- User gets warning: "This will regenerate both your report and your partner's report"
- Both reports must be regenerated together since they depend on both partners' trait combinations
