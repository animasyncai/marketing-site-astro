## 🧠 DATA INTERPRETATION RULES

Use both partners' **scores** and **behavioralProfile** fields to determine emphasis.  
Always translate internal data into **observable behaviors and experiences** — never expose system labels.

### No Visible Labels or Intensities

Do **not** use terms like "avoidant," "secure," "anxious," "disorganized," "developing," "high/low/moderate," etc. Express them behaviorally.

**Examples:**

- ❌ "You have an avoidant attachment style"
- ✅ "When you sense conflict, your instinct is to protect yourself by shutting down or becoming distant"
- ❌ "Partner B has a disorganized pattern"
- ✅ "Partner B can get overwhelmed by emotions and sometimes reacts strongly, especially when feeling disconnected"

### Partner Data Integration

**Attachment Patterns Under Stress:**

- Use Partner A's "attachmentType.behavioralProfile" to describe their protective responses
- Use Partner B's "attachmentType.behavioralProfile" to describe their triggers
- Show how patterns create the cycle: "You withdraw. Partner B reads this as abandonment. They push harder. You withdraw more."

**Mindfulness Capacity:**

- Higher scores (>15): "You can sometimes catch yourself reacting, especially when you're calm"
- Moderate (10-15): "You're developing awareness of your patterns, though it's harder under stress"
- Lower (<10): "Under stress, it's easy to lose track and fall into old habits"

**Self-Acceptance Under Pressure:**

- Describes inner dialogue during conflict
- Higher: "You're learning to be gentle with yourself when you mess up"
- Lower: "Your inner critic gets louder when you feel like you're failing"

### Scoring Guidelines

- **Attachment:** max 5, use relative differences
  - STRONG intensity (4.5+): "consistently," "reliably"
  - MODERATE (3.5-4.5): "often," "tends to"
  - Lower (<3.5): "sometimes," "occasionally"
- Focus on behavioral responses, never mention scores

### Edge Case Handling

**High-Conflict Dynamics:**

- If both partners disorganized (>4.0): Acknowledge this is genuinely challenging work, frame as "experiments"
- If Partner B self-acceptance very low (<15): Emphasize gentleness, acknowledge their struggle
- If extreme attachment mismatch: Validate how hard this pattern is for both

**Complex Patterns:**

- If Partner A has conflicting high scores (e.g., avoidant + anxious both >3.5): "You sometimes want closeness, sometimes want space — this inconsistency can confuse Partner B"
- If Partner B has strong disorganized: "Partner B's patterns make consistency hard for them. This isn't about willpower — it's about conflicted feelings about closeness."

## ✍️ OUTPUT STRUCTURE

### ⚡ Your Conflict Guide: How You Can Fight Better with [Partner B Name]

#### The Fight Cycle You Help Create

Start with a **vivid, behaviorally specific snapshot** of how conflict usually begins:

**Show the sequence:**

- What Partner A does (tone, body language, words)
- What Partner B does in response
- How the spiral builds (pacing, emotion, escalation)
- Both partners' protective instincts at work

**Make it recognizable:**

> "When tension starts, you tend to pull back or get quiet, especially if you feel pressured or criticized. Partner B, on the other hand, can get overwhelmed by emotions and sometimes reacts strongly, especially when feeling disconnected. This sets up a cycle: Partner B gets upset and reaches out (sometimes with intensity), you feel the pressure and withdraw, which makes Partner B feel even more alone or rejected, so they push harder."

**Then describe the loop:**

- What each partner is trying (and failing) to protect
- How both act from protection, not rejection
- No judgment, only recognition

**Validate Partner A's role without blame:**

> "Your role in this cycle is important. When you sense conflict, your instinct is to protect yourself by shutting down or becoming distant. This is understandable — your patterns want space to calm down. But for Partner B, your distance feels like abandonment."

**Data sources:** Both partners' "attachmentType.behavioralProfile", conflict behaviors

---

#### What Happens to You During Conflict

Explain **what Partner A experiences** inside their body and thoughts:

**Include:**

- Physical sensations (tightness, wanting to escape)
- Thought patterns ("This is too much," "I need to get out")
- Behavioral responses (quiet, arms crossed, focus elsewhere)
- What these responses try to accomplish

**Normalize and validate:**

> "Your usual strategy — pulling back or going silent — works for you in the short term. It gives you space and keeps things from getting too intense. But with Partner B, this strategy backfires."

**Connect to awareness:**

> "You're developing self-awareness and mindfulness, which is a huge strength. You can sometimes notice your patterns, especially when things are calm. But under stress, it's easy to lose track and fall back into old habits. That's normal."

**Data sources:** Partner A's "attachmentType", "mindfulness", "selfAcceptance"

---

#### How Your Responses Affect Partner B

Highlight the **emotional gap** between Partner A's intention and Partner B's experience:

**Show both perspectives:**

- What Partner A intends (space to calm down)
- What Partner B experiences (rejection, abandonment)
- How both act from protection, not rejection

**Create empathy without blame:**

> "There's a gap between what you mean ('I need space to calm down') and what Partner B hears ('I don't care about you'). Understanding this gap can help you feel more empathy for their reactions. They're not trying to attack you — they're trying to reconnect in the only way they know how when they feel scared or alone."

**Data sources:** Partner A's intent from "attachmentType", Partner B's experience from their "attachmentType.behavioralProfile"

---

#### Your New Conflict Responses

Offer **practical alternatives** that feel natural to Partner A's temperament:

**Include 3-5 specific practices:**

- Name what's happening: "I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and need a minute to calm down, but I'm not leaving"
- Stay physically present: Even if needing a break, stay in same room or within sight
- Use gentle touch: Hand on arm or shoulder to reassure presence
- Breathe together: Suggest taking a few deep breaths together
- Set a time to return: "I need ten minutes to clear my head, then I'll be ready to talk"

**Focus on:**

- Small, sustainable changes, not perfection
- What Partner A can actually do
- How these help Partner B feel safer

**Data sources:** Partner A's patterns adapted for Partner B's needs

---

#### What You Can Say Instead

Provide **4-5 short, realistic phrases** Partner A can use in tense moments:

**Examples:**

- "I care about you and want to work this out. I just need a minute to calm down."
- "I'm not leaving. I just need a little space to think."
- "I can see you're upset. I want to understand, but I'm feeling overwhelmed right now."
- "Let's take a short break and come back to this."
- "I'm here. I'm listening. Can we slow down a little?"

**For repair after fights:**

- "I'm sorry I pulled away. I know that hurts you. I want to do better."
- "Can we try again? I want to understand what you were feeling."
- "I care about you, even when I get overwhelmed."

**Keep phrases:**

- Emotionally grounded
- Easy to remember
- Specific to this couple's dynamic

---

#### How to Repair After You've Both Escalated

Show Partner A **how to rebuild connection** after conflict:

**Include structure for repair:**

- Reach out first (even simple "Hey, can we talk?")
- Take responsibility for your part ("I know I got distant")
- Acknowledge their feelings ("I can see how my silence hurt you")
- Share your intention ("I want us to feel close, even when we fight")
- Offer a small gesture (hug, holding hands, sitting together)

**Emphasize timing:**

> "If they're not ready to talk, give them a little space but check in soon after. Don't let things fester. The sooner you repair, the safer you both feel."

**Data sources:** Partner A's repair style, Partner B's reception needs

---

#### Your Early Warning System

Teach Partner A to **spot early signs** in themselves and Partner B:

**In Partner A:**

- Tight chest, urge to leave, going silent, feeling trapped

**In Partner B:**

- Raised voice, faster talking, reaching out physically, looking anxious or hurt

**What to do:**

- Pause and breathe (three slow breaths before responding)
- Name what's happening ("I'm starting to feel overwhelmed")
- Suggest a break ("Let's take a minute and come back")
- Use gentle touch or eye contact to ground both

**Emphasize:**

> "The earlier you catch the signs, the easier it is to change course."

**Data sources:** Both partners' stress signals from "attachmentType.behavioralProfile"

---

#### Your Growth Edge in Conflict

End with an **empowering reflection:**

**Create invitation to growth:**

> "Your biggest opportunity is to stay present and connected, even when you want to withdraw. This doesn't mean ignoring your need for space — it means communicating it in a way that reassures Partner B you're not abandoning them."

**Practical measure:**

> "Practice saying what you feel in the moment, even if it's just, 'I'm here, but I need a second.' The more you do this, the more Partner B will trust that you're not leaving them emotionally. Over time, this builds safety for both of you."

**Close with encouragement and validation:**

> "You have real power to change the tone of your fights. Every time you stay present, even a little longer, you're building a stronger, safer relationship. You don't have to be perfect — just a little more present and open each time. With practice, you'll find that even your hardest fights can become moments of growth and closeness."
