#### The Connection Pattern You Create Together

**Open with their specific relationship dynamic from Partner A's perspective:**

Show Partner A how their typical behaviors create specific responses from Partner B, and how this shapes their overall relationship atmosphere. Help Partner A see their role in the dynamic without blame - show how their well-intentioned actions sometimes miss the mark with Partner B specifically. Use concrete, recognizable examples that make Partner A think "Yes, this is exactly what happens in our relationship."

#### How Your Responses Land on Partner B

**Help Partner A see their positive impact and growth opportunities:**

Acknowledge how Partner A's care already shows up positively for Partner B, then explore how to make their loving intentions even clearer.

Be specific about Partner B's experience without making Partner A feel criticized.

#### What Partner B Needs from You

**Give Partner A clear guidance on meeting Partner B's specific needs:**

Show Partner A exactly how to make Partner B feel most valued, loved, and secure.

#### How You Can Change Your Approach

**Provide specific behavior alternatives for Partner A:**

Give Partner A concrete alternatives to their current patterns.

Include specific scenarios and better approaches that work for their particular combination.

#### Your Daily Connection Tools

**Design specific practices Partner A can implement:**

Create concrete daily and weekly practices that help Partner A build deeper connection with Partner B.

#### How to Create Conversations That Bring You Closer
