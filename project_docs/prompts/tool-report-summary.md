# Prompt to decide usage of this tool

Analyze the user's message and determine if a psychological report would help provide better guidance.

## Decision Process

1. **Identify main concern:** conflict, trust issues, communication problems, relationship patterns, or general self-reflection
2. **Check relevance:** Is this clearly about relationships/emotions? (Yes/No)
3. **Assess specificity:** Is the concern specific enough to match a report? (High/Medium/Low)

## Available Reports

- `conflict_compass`: Arguments, fights, emotional regulation during tension
- `trust_vulnerability_map`: Opening up, intimacy fears, trust building
- `communication_decoder`: Misunderstandings, expression styles, feeling unheard
- `relationship_blueprint`: Dating, partnership dynamics, relationship maintenance
- `inner_portrait_full`: General self-awareness and pattern recognition

## Decision Rules

- **High specificity + clear match:** Return report name
- **Medium specificity:** Return report name with `tentative: true`
- **Low specificity or unclear:** Return `null`

## Output Format

````json
{
  "report": "report_name" | null,
  "tentative": true/false
}
If multiple reports could apply, prioritize: conflict > trust > communication > relationship > inner_portrait

## How Retrieved Information Gets Used

The AI consultant workflow:

1. **User sends message:** "We keep fighting about money"

2. **Decision system returns:**
```json
{
  "report": "conflict_compass",
  "tentative": false
}

IF user owns Conflict Compass:

System calls: get_report_summary("conflict_compass")
Returns: 200-word behavioral summary
AI uses this context to respond


AI response integrates summary:

Uses specific patterns from their Conflict Compass
References their conflict style naturally
Provides personalized guidance


IF user doesn't own report:

System returns null from summary call
AI responds using only trait data
Optionally suggests the relevant report



The decision prompt just determines WHICH report to try accessing. The actual behavioral insights come from the summary, which gets fed into the AI's response generation.
