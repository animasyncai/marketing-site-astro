## 💫 Your Love Guide: How You Can Connect Deeper with Partner B

### The Connection Pattern You Create Together

Begin with a short, _behaviorally specific snapshot_ of how Partner A and Partner B typically connect.  
Describe what Partner A does first, how Partner B responds, and the subtle emotional rhythm that follows.

### What Partner B Needs from You

Offer clear, specific guidance for Partner A:
