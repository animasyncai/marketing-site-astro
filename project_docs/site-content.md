# Opening Hook

## We all carry patterns we can't quite name.

Why some people feel like home. Why conflict makes us shut down—or fight for closeness. Why love can feel both safe and scary. Why we sometimes push away what we need most.

Withinly helps you see these patterns — not with labels or quick fixes, but through deep reflection and an ongoing dialogue with an AI that builds on what you share with nuance and care. Useful whether you’re single, in a relationship, or simply curious about your inner world.

> "This isn’t about labels. It’s about finally having words for your story.""

# How It Works Section

Comment // These cards should be equal height / have similar amount of characters as content

## A journey inward, at your own pace

Self‑understanding isn’t a destination. It unfolds. Each reflection builds on the last—and your AI consultant carries the thread using your traits and recent conversations.

### 1. Start with gentle discovery

Label above title: Begin

Short, thoughtful trait check‑ins help you notice how you relate, express love, and respond under stress. No right answers—just honest noticing.

Tag below content: Curiosity

### 2. Receive your Inner Portrait

Label above title: Begin

A personal narrative that brings your traits together with warmth and clarity. Free members get the essence; full members unlock deeper, integrative insight.

Tag below content: Recognition

### 3. Begin the conversation

Label above title: Begin

Meet your AI consultant—grounded in psychological wisdom, speaking like a trusted friend. It uses your traits and recent reflections to help you make sense of patterns and support you as they evolve.

Tag below content: Recognition

### 4. Go deeper when you're ready

Label above title: Grow

Unlock specialized reports—Conflict Compass, Relationship Blueprint, Stress Signals, and more. Explore simulated dynamics or sync privately with a real partner.
