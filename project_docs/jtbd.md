# JTBD (Jobs to be done)

The goal of this document is to define marketing material tobe used to frame value.active

General acknowledgments:
- Your product offers **psychological self-reflection**, built on rich structured trait data (attachment, love language, mindfulness, etc.).
- You avoid rigid diagnostics or labeling — instead, you focus on **relational insight**, **emotional nuance**, and **compassionate growth**.
- It uses AI to generate deep, thoughtful reports (individual and couple-based), including things like *Inner Portrait*, *Conflict Compass*, *Relationship Blueprint*, and fictional partner dynamics.
- You plan to have a **tiered token-based monetization system**.
- Your audience cares deeply about **growth**, **connection**, and **emotional understanding**, not gimmicks.

## ✅ Primary Job:

**"Help me understand the emotional patterns that shape how I connect — so I can grow, relate better, and make sense of my inner world."**

This is the emotional core. Users want clarity. Not just “what am I?” but “why do I act this way?”

Not just “how do we match?” but “how can we *meet* each other better?”

They want language for the *unspoken* — feelings they struggle to articulate.

---

## 🧠 Functional Jobs:

- Reveal **how I behave in relationships** (patterns, defenses, needs).
- Offer **gentle, private reflection** without feeling judged or diagnosed.
- Simulate or visualize **how I interact with others** (especially romantic partners).
- Make sense of emotional tensions and reactions I’ve always had but never understood.
- Let me **invite my partner** or compare dynamics when I’m ready.
- Guide me with practices and gentle nudges, not lectures or rigid rules.

---

## 💓 Emotional Jobs:

- Help me **feel seen** and understood — even in my messiest emotional parts.
- Reassure me that I’m not broken.
- Let me explore my inner world **without shame**.
- Give me the words I never had to explain myself — to me or someone else.
- Show me that **connection is possible**, even when things feel hard.

---

## 🧲 Desired Outcomes:

- Language to explain myself and my needs (to a partner or therapist).
- Tools for managing conflict and closeness.
- More peaceful, self-aware relationships.
- Confidence that I’m growing emotionally.
- Permission to be complex — without being “diagnosed.”

### 📦 Competing Alternatives (JTBD competition lens)

When someone is trying to “do” this job, what else might they hire?

| Alternative | Strengths | Weaknesses Compared to You |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Therapy (talk or couples) | Deep, personal | Expensive, slow, vulnerable to judgment |
| Books/workbooks on attachment, etc. | Low cost, informative | Generic, hard to personalize |
| Personality quizzes (e.g., 16personalities) | Fun, quick | Shallow, overly labeled |
| Journaling / reflection tools | Flexible, private | Unguided, no feedback |
| Meditation / mindfulness apps | Emotionally regulating | Not insight-driven |

Your tool sits right in the sweet spot between **insight + action**, **depth + gentleness**, **therapy-quality reflection** at **scalable access**.
