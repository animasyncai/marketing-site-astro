## Data Interpretation Rules

All reports must follow these data handling guidelines:

**Always Use:**

- ✅ `behavioralProfile` text to understand patterns
- ✅ Scores to determine emphasis and strength
- ✅ Behavioral descriptions translated into user language

**Never Expose:**

- ❌ System labels (Avoidant, Secure, Quality Time, Physical Touch, etc.)
- ❌ Level descriptors (Developing, Moderate, High, Low, etc.)
- ❌ Numeric scores directly
- ❌ Clinical terminology

**Trait-Specific Guidelines:**

- **Love Language:** Translate categories into specific behaviors, never use label names
- **Attachment:** Describe comfort with closeness/distance behaviorally, never use style names
- **Self-Acceptance:** Describe inner dialogue tone behaviorally, never use level labels
- **Mindfulness:** Describe awareness capacity behaviorally, never use level labels
