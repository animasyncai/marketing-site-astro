**Purpose:** This document defines the scope, territory, and differentiation strategy for all Withinly premium reports. Use this as the baseline when creating or refining report prompts.

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-XX

**Status:** MVP (Inner Portrait, Conflict Compass, Communication Decoder) + Post-MVP (Trust & Vulnerability Map)

---

## Core Principle

**Each report solves a DIFFERENT user need at a DIFFERENT moment.**

Reports must be:

- ✅ **Educative** - Pattern recognition and explanation
- ✅ **Revealing** - Aha moments and blind spots
- ✅ **Actionable** - Practical next steps and specific strategies

Reports must NOT:

- ❌ Overlap in territory
- ❌ Repeat the same insights
- ❌ Make users feel they've "already read this"

---

## Report Architecture

### Comprehensive Understanding

**Inner Portrait** - WHO you are across all contexts

### Situational Application

**Conflict Compass** - Fighting and repair (reactive)

**Communication Decoder** - Expression and connection (proactive)

**Trust & Vulnerability Map** - Intimacy and opening up (depth progression) *[POST-MVP]*

---

---

## Boundary Enforcement Rules

### Territory Check

If writing a report and you include these phrases, you're in wrong territory:

**"During a fight..."** → STOP. That's Conflict Compass.

**"In daily interactions..."** → Check: Is this conflict? If no, could be Communication Decoder.

**"When opening up emotionally..."** → STOP. That's Trust Map.

**"Who you are..."** → Check: Is this identity? If yes, could be Inner Portrait.

**"After a fight..."** → STOP. That's Conflict Compass repair section.

**"Before resentment builds..."** → Communication Decoder territory.

### Overlap Prevention Checklist

Before finalizing any report, ask:

1. ✅ Could this advice/insight fit in another report?
2. ✅ Am I explaining the same pattern different ways?
3. ✅ Would user say "I already read this in X report"?
4. ✅ Does this stay within the defined time frame?
5. ✅ Am I using the correct trait combination?

If any answer is "maybe" → revise to respect boundaries.

### Red Flags

**Report overlap indicators:**

- Same behavioral sequence in multiple reports
- Same advice phrased differently
- Same trait pattern explained multiple times
- No clear reason user would buy both reports

**If detected:** Reassign content to correct report or eliminate redundancy.
