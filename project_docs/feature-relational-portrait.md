## 🎯 Report Differentiation

### How They're Different

| Report                   | Focus             | User Moment           | Both See Same?    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Couple Snapshot**      | Quick recognition | Curiosity/First sync  | Yes               |
| **Relationship Compass** | Daily connection  | Disconnection (calm)  | No (personalized) |
| **Conflict Compass**     | Fighting & repair | During/after conflict | No (personalized) |

### Territory Protection

**Snapshot** = Recognition without solutions  
**Relationship Compass** = Daily life, NOT conflict  
**Conflict Compass** = Conflict only, NOT daily life

No overlap. Different moments. Different needs.

## 🔄 Flow for Invitation and Acceptance

### When Sending Invite

1. User enters email (no dropdown, no validation feedback)
2. System checks silently:
   - If account exists → Send in-app notification + email
   - If no account → Send email with invitation to join + explanation
3. User sees generic success: "Invitation sent to [email]"
4. Once accepted, user sees partner's name and sync status

### Email Templates

- `emails/couple-sync-account-exists.md`
- `emails/couple-sync-no-account.md`

---

## ⚠️ User Safety Checks

### Before Sync Modal

**Before You Connect With Your Partner**

When you sync accounts:

- Your individual traits and chat history stay private
- Only couple insights (reports, snapshots) are visible to both of you
- **If either of you unlinks, all couple reports are deleted** and both lose access
- Use these insights to understand each other better, not to manipulate or control

**Don't sync if:**

- You feel pressured or coerced by your partner
- Your relationship involves abuse or coercion
- You're not comfortable sharing relationship insights
