## User safety checks

Before sending or accepting a partner sync we will show this modal:

**Before You Connect With Your Partner**

When you sync accounts:

- Your individual traits and chat history stay private
- Only couple insights (reports, snapshots) are visible to both of you
- **If either of you unlinks, all couple reports are deleted** and both lose access
- Use these insights to understand each other better, not to manipulate or control

**Don't sync if:**

- You feel pressured or coerced by your partner
- Your relationship involves abuse or coercion
- You're not comfortable sharing relationship insights
