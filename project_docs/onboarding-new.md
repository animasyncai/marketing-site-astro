# Onboarding

This document is a guide for the onboarding process of a new user.

Here is the step by step process that is presented in the middle of the screen, simulating a chat-like experience. Each step is separated with ---.

# Welcome to Withinly!

This isn’t about right or wrong answers. It’s about stories — how you meet yourself, and how you meet others. With just a little reflection, I can begin showing you patterns you may have felt but never fully named.

Shall we begin?

[Let’s begin]

What should I call you?

<input>  
Your name  
[input box]  
You can use your full name or a nickname — whatever feels most like you.  
</input>

What best describes your current situation?

[In a relationship]  
[Single]  
[It’s complicated / not sure]  
[Prefer not to say]

(If “in a relationship” → expands to: “How long have you been together?” [< 1 year, 1–3 years, 3–5 years, 5–10 years, 10+ years])

Choose where to begin.  
Each path opens a short reflection (300–500 words) built from just a few questions.

[Discover Your Connection Map]  
_A first look at how you reach for closeness and how you express care in relationships_

[See Your Trust & Safety Patterns]  
_A glimpse into how you balance closeness with your own inner safety and inner voice_

[Find Your Inner Compass]  
_A reflection on how you notice yourself, your emotions, and how you respond to them_

## If user chooses a path

Example: **Connection Map**

# About Traits

What you just explored is built from what we call a **trait** — a short reflection that captures one dimension of how you relate and grow.

Each trait is like a building block. Collect a few, and they come together into bigger portraits — like the _Inner Portrait_ or the _Conflict Compass_.

And traits aren’t fixed. As you work with them, they can shift and evolve — showing how your patterns change over time.

[Show me what’s next]

# What Awaits You

With more reflections, you’ll unlock your **full Inner Portrait** — a deeper map of how all your patterns meet.

You’ll also be able to explore other portraits:

[GRID OF LOCKED REPORT CARDS, blurred preview, same style as reports page]

- **Inner Portrait (Full)** — _How all your patterns meet and shape your emotional world_
- **Conflict Compass** — _How you move through tension and find your way back to connection_
- **Relationship Blueprint** — _How you bond, what draws you close, and what keeps you safe_
- **Trust & Vulnerability Map** — _How you open up, protect yourself, and build intimacy_
- **Communication Decoder** — _How you express care and what helps you return to balance_

Each card: [Locked — requires Sparks ✨]
