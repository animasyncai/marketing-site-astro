# Privacy & Agreement

Before we begin, a few important things.

Withinly helps you understand your emotional patterns through AI-guided reflection. We take your privacy seriously, but you should know: our AI processes your data to generate insights, and like any AI, it can sometimes make mistakes or misunderstand. You're responsible for how you use these insights.

☐ I understand Withinly is not therapy and is for personal reflection only
☐ I understand the AI can make mistakes and insights may not always be accurate
☐ I agree to the [Terms of Service](terms-of-service.md) and [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md)

# Welcome to Withinly!

This isn't about right or wrong answers. It's about stories — how you meet yourself, and how you meet others. With just a little reflection, I can begin showing you patterns you may have felt but never fully named.

Shall we begin?

[Let's begin]

What should I call you?

<input>

You can use your full name or a nickname — whatever feels most like you.

What best describes your current situation?

[In a relationship]  
[Single]

Choose where to begin.  
Each path opens a short reflection built from just a few questions.

[Discover Your Connection Map]  
_A first look at how you reach for closeness and how you express care in relationships_

[See Your Trust & Safety Patterns]  
_A glimpse into how you balance closeness with your own inner safety and inner voice_

[Find Your Inner Compass]  
_A reflection on how you notice yourself, your emotions, and how you respond to them_

# About Traits

What you just explored is built from what we call **traits** — small reflections that capture one dimension of how you connect, love, or relate to yourself.

Each trait is a building block. Collect more, and they combine into bigger portraits — like your _Inner Portrait_ or the _Conflict Compass_.

And traits aren’t fixed. They can shift and evolve as you do. Retaking them later shows how your patterns change over time.

[Show me what’s next]

# ✨ Sparks & What Awaits You

Each Spark unlocks one new step — a reflection, a deeper report, or a conversation.

# Consultant Intro Messages (Predefined)

The consultant’s very first message after onboarding depends on the starter report the user chose.

- [Care — the way I usually show love]
- [How these two pieces fit together]

---

## If Trust & Safety Patterns (Attachment + Self-Acceptance)

- [The way I protect myself in relationships]
- [The way I question or trust my own needs]
- [How protection and trust connect for me]
