# Welcome to Withinly!

Shall we begin?

# About Traits

What you just explored is built from what we call **traits** â€” small reflections that capture one dimension of how you connect, love, or relate to yourself.

Each trait is a building block. Collect more, and they combine into bigger portraits â€” like your _Inner Portrait_ or the _Conflict Compass_.

And traits arenâ€™t fixed. They can shift and evolve as you do. Retaking them later shows how your patterns change over time.

[Show me whatâ€™s next]
