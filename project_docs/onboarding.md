# Privacy & Agreement (Slide B)

Before we begin, a few important things.

Withinly helps you understand your emotional patterns through AI-guided reflection. We take your privacy seriously, but you should know: our AI processes your data to generate insights, and like any AI, it can sometimes make mistakes or misunderstand. You're responsible for how you use these insights.

☐ I understand Withinly is not therapy and is for personal reflection only
☐ I understand the AI can make mistakes and insights may not always be accurate
☐ I agree to the [Terms of Service](terms-of-service.md) and [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md)

# Welcome to Withinly! (Slide C)

This isn't about right or wrong answers. It's about stories — how you meet yourself, and how you meet others. With just a little reflection, I can begin showing you patterns you may have felt but never fully named.

Shall we begin?

[Let's begin]

What should I call you? (Slide D)

<input>
Your name  
[input box]  
You can use your full name or a nickname — whatever feels most like you.

What best describes your current situation? (Slide E)

[In a relationship]  
[Single]  
[It's complicated / not sure]  
[Prefer not to say]
