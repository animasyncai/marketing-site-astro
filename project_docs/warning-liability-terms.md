First thing before we allow user to onboard is this statement:

```
Title: Privacy and Agreement

Before we begin, a few important things,

Withinly helps you understand your emotional patterns through AI-guided reflection. We take your privacy seriously, but you should know: our AI processes your data to generate insights, and like any AI, it can sometimes make mistakes or misunderstand. You're responsible for how you use these insights.

☐ I understand Withinly is not therapy and I'm responsible for my own decisions
☐ I understand the AI can make mistakes and insights may not always be accurate
☐ I agree to the [Terms of Service] and [Privacy Policy]

## Before User Sync

Before user sync (both invite and accept) we provide this text:

```
Before You Connect With Your Partner
When you sync accounts:

Your individual traits and chat history stay private
Only couple insights (reports, snapshots) are visible to both of you
If either of you unlinks, all couple reports are deleted and both lose access
Use these insights to understand each other better, not to manipulate or control

Don't sync if:

You feel pressured or coerced by your partner
Your relationship involves abuse or coercion
You're not comfortable sharing relationship insights

[Cancel] [I Understand, Continue]
```
