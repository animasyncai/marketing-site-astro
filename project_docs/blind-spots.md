## üö® Critical (Immediate Attention Required)

### 1. Data Privacy, Security & GDPR Compliance

**Risk:** You're handling extremely sensitive psychological data including intimate relationship details, vulnerabilities, private reflections, and couple dynamics.

**Questions:**

- Is your encryption strategy production-ready (at rest + in transit)?
- GDPR compliance checklist complete? (data portability, right to deletion, consent flows)
- Data breach response plan in place?
- How are you implementing "right to deletion" with Partner Sync? (what happens to couple data?)
- Data retention policies defined?
- Third-party processor agreements (OpenAI) reviewed for GDPR?

**Impact:** Legal liability, user trust destruction, potential fines, business shutdown.

**Action needed:** Legal review + technical security audit before public launch.

---

### 2. Content Moderation, Crisis Response & Mandatory Reporting

**Risk:** Chat conversations could reveal domestic violence, suicidal ideation, child safety concerns, or abuse.

**Questions:**

- Do you have mandatory reporting obligations in your jurisdiction?
- When do you escalate vs maintain neutrality?
- What's your crisis intervention protocol? (suicide hotline referrals, emergency contact triggers)
- How do you detect concerning content without violating privacy?
- Who monitors flagged conversations? (legal liability for human reviewers)
- What's your response time for critical incidents?

**Impact:** Legal liability, moral responsibility, user safety, regulatory scrutiny.

**Action needed:** Crisis response protocol + legal consultation on reporting obligations.

---

### 3. Professional Liability & Terms of Service

**Risk:** Providing psychological insights that could influence major life decisions (leaving relationships, confronting partners, parenting choices).

**Questions:**

- Are your disclaimers legally sufficient? ("Not therapy" may not be enough)
- Professional liability insurance needed?
- What happens if someone makes a harmful relationship decision based on your AI's guidance?
- Are you protected from "AI gave bad advice" lawsuits?
- How do you handle users who expect clinical-level accuracy?
- Terms of Service reviewed by lawyer specializing in digital health/psychology?

**Impact:** Lawsuits, reputation damage, business closure.

**Action needed:** Legal review of T&S, disclaimers, and liability insurance consultation.

---

### 4. Partner Sync Safety & Toxic Relationship Dynamics

**Risk:** In toxic or abusive relationships, Partner Sync could become a tool for manipulation, coercion, or psychological harm.

**Questions:**

- What if one partner uses trait insights to manipulate the other?
- What if someone pressures their partner to sync to "prove" commitment?
- What if trait data becomes ammunition in fights? ("See, you ARE avoidant!")
- How do you detect power imbalances or coercive dynamics?
- When should you recommend NOT syncing?
- Do you need abuse detection systems in couple reports?

**Impact:** User harm, enablement of abuse, legal liability, reputation destruction.

**Action needed:** Safety protocols, warning copy in Partner Sync flow, abuse detection research.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority (Address Before Scale)

### 5. Quality Control & AI Response Monitoring at Scale

**Risk:** Highly personalized AI responses can't be manually reviewed. Bad advice could spread undetected.

**Questions:**

- How do you ensure quality when you can't review every conversation?
- What if the AI gives harmful relationship advice?
- How do you detect when consultant responses go off-rails?
- What's your QA sampling strategy? (random audits, flagged content review)
- Who reviews concerning AI behaviors?
- How do you update consultant prompt when issues emerge?

**Impact:** User harm, reputation damage, scaling blocked by quality concerns.

**Action needed:** QA protocol, automated quality metrics, human review system.

---

### 6. AI Vendor Lock-in & Cost Volatility

**Risk:** Heavy OpenAI dependency with thin margins (especially on chat).

**Questions:**

- What if GPT-4.1 pricing increases 3x?
- What if model behavior changes after updates, breaking your prompts?
- What if OpenAI restricts psychological use cases in their terms?
- Can you migrate to alternative models without rebuilding everything?
- What's your break-even if AI costs double?

**Impact:** Margin destruction, forced price increases, business model failure.

**Action needed:** Cost monitoring alerts, alternative model testing, margin sensitivity analysis.

---

### 7. Relationship Status Changes & Data Relevance

**Risk:** Life changes (breakups, new relationships) make existing data outdated or emotionally painful.

**Questions:**

- User breaks up with partner they synced with‚Äîwhat happens to couple data?
- Do reports become irrelevant after breakup?
- Should you offer "post-relationship reflection" reports?
- How do you handle Partner Sync unlinking gracefully?
- What if someone enters a new relationship‚Äîdo they start fresh or carry old data?
- Can past relationship patterns inform future ones without being traumatic?

**Impact:** User churn, emotional harm, data relevance decay.

**Action needed:** Relationship status change UX flow, data archival vs deletion options.

---

### 8. Trait Validity & Professional Credibility

**Risk:** Simplified psychological frameworks may not withstand professional scrutiny or user skepticism.

**Questions:**

- Are 12 questions enough for valid attachment assessment?
- What happens when users don't recognize themselves in results?
- How will licensed therapists react to your simplified frameworks?
- Can you defend your methodology against academic critique?
- What if users feel "mis-typed" and lose trust?
- Should you publish validation studies or methodology transparency?

**Impact:** Credibility loss, professional backlash, user distrust.

**Action needed:** Methodology documentation, potential validation study, expert advisory board.

---

### 9. Retention After Free Tier Exhaustion

**Risk:** Your break-even scenarios assume 4-8% conversion. Actual could be <2%.

**Questions:**

- What if actual conversion is <2% in beta?
- Is your free tier too generous? (3 Sparks + free Couple Snapshot + free traits)
- What's your fallback monetization if pay-per-Spark doesn't work?
- Should you introduce a low-tier subscription ($2.99/month) for retention?
- How do you re-engage users who exhausted free Sparks and didn't buy?

**Impact:** Revenue model failure, runway burn, forced pivot.

**Action needed:** Beta conversion tracking, fallback monetization options, re-engagement experiments.

---

## üìã Medium Priority (Monitor & Plan)

### 10. Competitor Response & Moat Defensibility

**Observation:** Your psychological prompts are your main moat, but large players could replicate quickly.

**Questions:**

- What stops Paired, Lasting, or BetterHelp from adding trait assessments?
- What stops OpenAI from offering "relationship coaching" with ChatGPT?
- Can you patent or protect your methodology?
- What's your 2-year advantage window?

**Impact:** Competition erosion, forced differentiation, market share loss.

**Strategy:** Build brand + community moat, focus on couples market they ignore, consider B2B (therapists).

---

### 11. Multi-Language Quality & Cultural Adaptation

**Risk:** Psychological concepts don't translate 1:1 across cultures.

**Questions:**

- Will Lithuanian translations maintain nuance of English prompts?
- Do "love languages" have cultural validity outside Western contexts?
- Are attachment styles universal or culturally influenced?
- Cost of maintaining prompt quality across languages?
- Do you need culturally-adapted assessments vs direct translations?

**Impact:** Poor user experience in non-English markets, wasted translation investment.

**Strategy:** Start with English-speaking markets, pilot Lithuanian carefully, learn before expanding.

---

### 12. Trait Staleness & Data Validity Over Time

**Risk:** User completed traits 8 months ago but consultant is working with outdated data.

**Questions:**

- How do you detect when traits are stale?
- Should you auto-prompt retakes after 6 months?
- What if users have genuinely changed but don't realize it?
- Do you discount older data in consultant responses?
- How do you encourage retakes without being annoying?

**Impact:** Poor AI guidance, user frustration ("This doesn't fit me anymore").

**Strategy:** Add "last updated" timestamps, gentle retake prompts, version tracking for reports.

---

### 13. Polyamorous & Non-Traditional Relationships (Future Scope)

**Observation:** Partner Sync is 1:1 only, but alternative relationship structures exist.

**Questions:**

- Market opportunity or scope creep?
- Could you support polyamorous relationships (multiple syncs)?
- What about chosen family, non-romantic deep friendships?
- Is this a differentiation opportunity or distraction?

**Impact:** Market expansion vs focus dilution.

**Strategy:** Monitor demand signals in beta, keep as Phase 2+ feature.

---

## üìä Monitoring (Partially Addressed, Track Metrics)

### 14. Chat Pricing Perception (Addressed by tiered model)

**Status:** You have 20 msgs/Spark (Standard) vs 5 msgs/Spark (Depth).

**Monitor:** Do users perceive this as fair value? Track Spark spending ratio (chat vs reports).

---

### 15. User Expectation Management (Addressed in positioning)

**Status:** Clear "not therapy" positioning in copy.

**Monitor:** Do users still push boundaries? Track support tickets asking for diagnosis/advice.

---

### 16. Chat Conversation Limits (Addressed by pricing tiers)

**Status:** Standard mode = affordable depth, Depth mode = premium quality.

**Monitor:** Are users satisfied with message limits? Do they feel nickeled-and-dimed?
