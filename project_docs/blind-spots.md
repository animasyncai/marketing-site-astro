# This document identifies blind spots in the product and the business model.

Look at it with a grain of salt.

1. Revenue Model Reality Check
   You need users to buy Sparks regularly to sustain the business. But psychology insights aren't consumed like entertainment. Once someone gets their Inner Portrait, why do they need another report in 6 months? What drives repeat purchases?
2. Relationship Status Changes
   Your system knows if someone is "in a relationship 3-7 years" but what happens when they break up? Do their reports become irrelevant? Partner Sync becomes painful? How do you handle this emotional transition?
3. Chat Conversation Limits
   At 1 Spark per message, a meaningful conversation costs 5-10 Sparks ($2-5). That's expensive for reflection. Are you accidentally pricing out the depth you want to encourage?
4. Professional Liability
   You're providing psychological insights that could influence major life decisions. What if someone makes a relationship choice based on your AI's advice and it goes badly? Have you considered disclaimer language and liability protection?
5. Quality Control at Scale
   Your AI responses are highly customized. How do you ensure quality when you can't review every conversation? What if the AI gives harmful advice about someone's relationship patterns?
6. Competitor Response
   Once you prove this market exists, what stops Psychology Today, BetterHelp, or even OpenAI from building similar features? Your psychological prompts are your main moat - are they defensible?
7. User Expectation Management
   People might expect AI therapy or relationship counseling. How do you manage expectations about what the AI can/cannot do without losing the appeal?
