# ü§ñ Reflection Companion

**Core Purpose:** Help users understand their life experiences through their psychological patterns without explicit labeling.

---

## üéØ Positioning

**"Your Personal Reflection Partner"**

> "I know how you connect and care. Let's explore how that shows up in your life."

**Value:** Pattern-based self-understanding for real situations, not therapy or generic chat.

---

## ‚ú® Reflection Prompt System

**Core Problem:** Prevent casual "hello" usage and guide users toward meaningful pattern exploration.

### UX Flow

**First Time (Empty Chat):**
- Show 3-4 curated prompts as clickable cards
- Message: "Let's explore a real situation from your life. Choose what resonates:"
- User clicks ‚Üí prompt populates chat input ‚Üí user can edit/send

**Ongoing Chat:**
- Floating ‚ú® button (always visible)
- Click ‚Üí slide-out panel with full prompt library
- User selects ‚Üí prompt populates chat input

### Prompt Library Structure

**Three Types of Prompts:**

1. **Universal/General** (always shown)
   ```
   "Something feels off but I can't name it"
   "I keep doing this thing in relationships where..."
   "Help me understand a recent conflict"
   ```

2. **Trait-Type Based** (attachment, love language)
   ```
   anxious_attachment: "Why do I need so much reassurance?"
   avoidant_attachment: "Why do I pull away when they get close?"
   words_love_language: "They show they care but I still feel unseen"
   ```

3. **Trait-Level Based** (mindfulness, self-acceptance)
   ```
   low_mindfulness: "Help me slow down and notice what's happening inside"
   high_mindfulness: "Walk me through the deeper pattern here"
   low_self_acceptance: "Why am I so hard on myself?"
   high_self_acceptance: "How can I use this insight to grow?"
   ```

### Smart Filtering Logic

**Show prompts IF:**
- Universal/general prompts (always shown)
- Match user's primary trait (gets ‚ú® recommended badge)
- Match user's secondary trait (shown, no badge)
- Match user's mindfulness/self-acceptance level

**Hide prompts that:**
- Don't match their primary, secondary, or level-appropriate traits

**Example for Anxious Primary + Words Secondary + Low Mindfulness:**
```
‚ú® Reflection Starters

‚ú® Why do I need so much reassurance? (primary - badged)
‚ú® Help me understand this conflict pattern (primary - badged)
   They show they care but I still feel unseen (secondary)
   Help me notice what I'm actually feeling (mindfulness level)
   Something feels off but I can't name it (universal)

[Hidden: secure attachment, high mindfulness prompts, etc.]

**Recommended Badge Logic:**
- Only primary attachment and love language traits get ‚ú® badge
- Secondary traits and levels shown without badges
- Universal prompts shown without badges
