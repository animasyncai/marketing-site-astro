# Marketing Audience

This document describes the core audience segments that Withinly is best positioned to serve.  
It supplements the JTBD by clarifying **who** to target, **what they feel**, and **why Withinly resonates**.

---

## 🎯 Core Audience Profile

- **Age**: 24–40
- **Gender**: Balanced, with higher early adoption from women and emotionally-aware men
- **Life stage**:
  - In a relationship (1–5 years, navigating closeness, conflict, or communication struggles)
  - OR single but actively self-reflective and relationship-minded
- **Mindset**: Curious, psychologically literate, open to self-growth without stigma
- **Geography**: English-speaking markets first (US, UK, Western Europe); adaptable to multi-language later

---

## 🧠 Audience Traits

- Familiar with concepts like attachment styles, love languages, mindfulness
- Frustrated that existing tools are either **too shallow** (personality quizzes) or **too heavy** (therapy, academic books)
- Seek **private, emotionally intelligent insights** without judgment
- Comfortable with AI if it feels **empathetic and safe**, not gimmicky

---

## ❤️ Pain Points

- _“I keep repeating the same patterns in relationships, but I don’t fully understand why.”_
- _“I want language to explain myself to my partner, but therapy feels too big of a step.”_
- _“I’m scared I’m broken, or too much, or not enough.”_
- _“We fight over small things, and I want to understand the deeper pattern.”_
- _“I know about attachment styles, but I want to see how it all connects in me (and us).”_

## ✅ What They Want

- Insight **deeper than a quiz**, but easier and safer than therapy
- **Recognition** — to feel seen in their messy patterns
- **Language** to use in conversations with partners or therapists
- **Clarity** about both themselves and their relationships
- A **safe, private space** that doesn’t judge, diagnose, or label

---

## 👌 Perfect-Use Scenarios

- **Couples**: Late 20s–30s, living together or considering long-term commitment.  
  Looking for tools to understand conflict cycles, mismatches, or intimacy gaps.

- **Singles**: Self-aware, therapy-friendly, wanting to prepare for healthier future relationships.

- **Therapy-adjacent users**: Already in therapy, using Withinly as a reflection tool that feeds language and clarity into sessions.

## 🚫 Not the Target Audience (MVP)
