        <li>Your individual trait details and chat history remain private</li>
        <li>
          <strong>If either partner unlinks:</strong> Both lose access to couple reports, and that data is deleted
        </li>
        <li>Don't use Partner Sync to manipulate, coerce, or harm your partner</li>
        <li>You're both responsible for how you use shared insights</li>
