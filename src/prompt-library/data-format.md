Consistent moderate mindfulness across areas. Development stable though not yet automatic. Regular practice maintaining steady progress. May have developed mindfulness skills through formal practice but struggles to bring awareness into daily life. Meditation cushion skills haven't fully transferred to real-world contexts."

Self-compassion emerges situationally but doesn't yet feel natural or automatic. Shows genuine interest in inner work. Benefits from practices that strengthen observing capacity and normalize the developmental process. Growth comes through regular practice and reducing perfectionism about the practice itself. Experiencing ambivalence about change. Simultaneously desires growth and fears it. Benefits from gentle exploration of both sides without pressure to resolve. Needs validation of complexity and support in taking small, emotionally safe steps when ready."
