        "You often find it hard to sit with parts of yourself, and that can make your inner world feel split. That resistance probably once protected you, even if now it feels heavy.",

      "behavioralProfile": "Limited capacity for self-reflection and emotional integration. Often experiences emotions at face value without deeper understanding of triggers or patterns. May feel disconnected from inner experience or use dissociation as emotional protection. Tends toward self-criticism rather than self-compassion. Limited ability to identify which inner parts are active during reactions. Benefits from very gentle, supportive approaches that build basic self-awareness without overwhelming the system."

Sometimes reflects on emotional triggers and behavioral patterns but answers often unclear or inconsistent. Occasionally feels detached from experience but can return to self-connection. Growing ability to listen to themselves with interest rather than immediate judgment. Inner witness is emerging but not yet stable or consistent."

Often connects emotions with deeper stories or past experiences. Developing self-compassion and ability to hold contradictions without breaking apart. Good balance between self-awareness and self-acceptance, though still integrating different aspects of self."

Strong inner witness that provides stability during difficult experiences. Integrated understanding of their patterns, triggers, and growth edges. Capable of holding complexity and contradiction with equanimity. Can identify which inner parts are active and speak from a centered place."
